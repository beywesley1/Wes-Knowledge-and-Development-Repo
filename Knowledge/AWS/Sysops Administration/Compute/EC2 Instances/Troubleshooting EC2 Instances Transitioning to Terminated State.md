### Troubleshooting EC2 Instances Transitioning to Terminated State

A leading media company employs various EC2 instances within their VPC, but they encounter a problem where certain instances transition from the pending state to the terminated state soon after a restart attempt.

#### Possible Causes for Instances Being Immediately Terminated:

1. **Each instance has an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) attached.**
2. **You have reached the limit on the number of instances that you can launch in a region.**
3. **The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part.**
4. **AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service your request.**
5. **You've reached your EBS volume limit.**

#### Correct Causes Explanation:

1. **The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part**:
    
    - **Why Correct**: Instance store-backed EC2 instances rely on the data in the instance store (ephemeral storage) for booting. If the AMI is corrupted or missing files, the instance cannot launch successfully, causing AWS to automatically terminate it. This is particularly relevant when instances are not able to transition out of the pending state after a restart, indicating an issue with the instance store or the AMI itself.
2. **You've reached your EBS volume limit**:
    
    - **Why Correct**: If the account has reached its EBS volume limit, no new EBS volumes can be created. Since EBS-backed instances require the creation of an EBS volume when they are launched (or restarted if the root volume needs to be created again), hitting this limit would prevent the instance from launching, resulting in its immediate termination.

#### Incorrect Options and Their Explanations:

1. **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) Attached**:
    
    - **Why Incorrect**: EFAs are network devices that enable instances to use remote direct memory access (RDMA) to enhance networking performance. While they can have specific requirements and limitations, merely having an EFA attached to an instance is not a typical cause for immediate termination after launching.
2. **Instance Limit Reached in a Region**:
    
    - **Why Incorrect**: If you reach the limit on the number of instances in a region, AWS will prevent you from launching additional instances and typically indicate this with a specific error message. However, it would not allow the instance to enter the pending state and then terminate it immediately; the launch process would not initiate at all.
3. **Lack of On-Demand Capacity**:
    
    - **Why Incorrect**: When AWS has no available On-Demand capacity, it may prevent you from launching instances, and this would also be indicated by an error message. However, similar to the instance limit, this would stop the instance from entering the pending state rather than causing it to terminate immediately after entering the pending state.
