###  Investigating EC2 Instance Termination After Pending State

#### Scenario Brief:

A SysOps Administrator experiences an issue where an EBS-backed On-Demand EC2 Instance, intended to host a web application, terminates immediately after entering the pending state. This behavior prevents the application from being deployed and accessible.

#### Potential Causes for the Issue:

1. **The root EBS volume is encrypted, and you do not have permission to access the KMS key for decryption**.
    
2. **The AMI used is corrupted**.
    
3. **The limit for EC2 Instances in your region has already been reached**.
    
4. **The EBS volume limit has been reached**.
    
5. **AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service your request**.
    

#### Correct Causes and Rationalization:

- **The root EBS volume is encrypted, and you do not have permission to access the KMS key for decryption**:
    
    - This issue arises when the EC2 instance attempts to access and boot from an encrypted EBS volume but lacks the necessary permissions to use the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key for decryption. Without access to decrypt the root volume, the instance cannot start, leading to its termination.
- **The EBS volume limit has been reached**:
    
    - Each AWS account has limits on the number of EBS volumes and the total storage that can be provisioned. If the account has reached its EBS volume limit, launching an additional EC2 instance with a new EBS volume would fail. This limitation can cause the instance to terminate after it enters the pending state, as it cannot successfully attach the required EBS volume.

#### Analysis of Other Options:

- **The AMI used is corrupted**:
    
    - While using a corrupted AMI can cause issues with launching EC2 instances, AWS typically checks the integrity of AMIs before allowing them to be used for instance creation. If an AMI were corrupted, it's more likely that AWS would prevent the instance from being launched at all, rather than allowing it to enter the pending state before terminating.
- **The limit for EC2 Instances in your region has already been reached**:
    
    - Reaching the EC2 instance limit for your AWS account in a specific region could prevent new instances from launching. However, in such cases, AWS would typically not allow the instance to enter the pending state, to begin with. The request to launch a new instance would be denied outright.
- **AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service your request**:
    
    - Lack of On-Demand capacity might prevent the launching of new instances in certain scenarios. However, AWS strives to maintain ample capacity for On-Demand instances, and capacity issues are more commonly associated with Spot Instances. When capacity is an issue, it's less likely to cause termination after the instance enters the pending state and more likely to result in an initial failure to launch.
