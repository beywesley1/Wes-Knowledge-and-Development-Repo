### Automating Remediation for Open SSH Ports in Security Groups

#### Scenario Context

A security audit has identified that certain security groups within a company's AWS environment are configured to allow inbound SSH traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0), posing a significant security risk. The system administrator is tasked with identifying these security groups and devising an automated solution to block open public-facing SSH ports.

#### Objective

Implement an automated solution to identify and remediate security groups allowing open SSH access from the internet.

#### Solutions for Addressing Open SSH Ports:

1. **Use the `restricted-ssh` AWS Config managed rule**:
    
    - **Description**: This rule identifies security groups that allow unrestricted SSH access.
2. **Remediation Actions**:
    
    - a. **AWS System Manager Automation Document**:
        - **Approach**: Create a remediation action using an AWS System Manager automation document to revoke ingress rules that permit SSH traffic from the public.
        - **Why Correct**: This method leverages AWS System Manager's capability to automate the process of revoking insecure ingress rules, directly addressing the compliance findings by AWS Config.
    - b. **Lambda Function**:
        - **Approach**: Create a remediation action using a Lambda function to revoke ingress rules allowing SSH traffic from the public.
        - **Why Correct**: Utilizing a Lambda function for remediation allows for flexible and custom scripting to specifically target and remove the identified insecure SSH ingress rules, offering a programmable and scalable solution.
3. **Other Considered Options**:
    
    - a. **Configure Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)**:
        - **Approach**: Configure EventBridge to trigger actions for revoking ingress rules that allow public SSH traffic upon detection of a non-compliant security group.
        - **Why Not Ideal**: While EventBridge can detect the issue and trigger a response, this option lacks the specificity of directly linking to an automation or function designed for remediation without further details on the remediation mechanism.
    - b. **AWS System Manager Compliance Document**:
        - **Approach**: Suggests creating a remediation action using a compliance document to revoke SSH ingress rules.
        - **Why Not Ideal**: The term "compliance document" is not a standard AWS System Manager term for automation or remediation actions, leading to confusion about the implementation method.

#### Key Insights

- **Automated Remediation**: Leveraging AWS Config's `restricted-ssh` rule in conjunction with either AWS System Manager automation documents or Lambda functions provides a robust automated solution for identifying and remedying security group configurations that allow open SSH access.
- **Security Best Practices**: Closing open SSH ports to the public internet is critical for maintaining the security posture of an AWS environment, preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Both AWS System Manager and AWS Lambda offer scalable solutions that can be tailored to the specific needs of the organization, ensuring that remediation actions are executed efficiently across multiple security groups.
