### Implementing Global Request Routing and Failover for a Multi-Regional Application

#### Scenario Overview

A global company operates an application across multiple AWS Regions, utilizing EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each region. The company aims to minimize latency by directing user requests to the geographically closest endpoint and requires a robust failover mechanism for rerouting traffic in case of regional endpoint failures. Additionally, the solution must support static IP addresses due to integration requirements with partners and third-party services through IP whitelisting.

#### Requirements and Solutions:

1. **Latency Reduction and Failover Capability**.
2. **Support for Static IP Addresses**.

#### Proposed Solutions:

1. **Route 53 with Failover Routing Policy**:
    
    - **Approach**: Configure A records with identical names for each endpoint, select a failover routing policy, and set up health checks for each endpoint.
    - **Limitation**: While supporting health checks and failover, this solution does not inherently provide static IP addresses for ALBs.
2. **Route 53 with Geoproximity Routing Policy**:
    
    - **Approach**: Configure A records with identical names for each endpoint, select geoproximity routing policy, and configure health checks.
    - **Limitation**: This method optimizes for geographic proximity but also does not address the requirement for static IP addresses.
3. **Route 53 with Health Checks**:
    
    - **Approach**: Configure A records for each endpoint with associated health checks but without specifying a routing policy.
    - **Limitation**: This configuration ensures health check-based routing without a specific focus on latency reduction or static IP provisioning.
4. **AWS Global Accelerator with Standard Accelerator Type**:
    
    - **Approach**: Set up an AWS Global Accelerator, create listeners, add an endpoint group for each region, and include endpoints in the respective groups.
    - **Why the Best Choice**: AWS Global Accelerator **provides two static IP addresses as part of the accelerator configuration**. It **routes user requests to the closest endpoint based on geographic location, improving latency**. The service also automatically handles failover to healthy endpoints in other regions if the primary endpoint becomes unavailable, meeting all specified requirements.

#### Analysis of Other Methods

1. **Route 53 Options**: While AWS Route 53 excels in DNS management and traffic routing based on various policies including health checks and geographical proximity, it does not provide static IP addresses for Application Load Balancers or EC2 instances directly. Integration with third-party services through IP whitelisting would thus be challenging without an additional layer or service providing static IPs.
    
2. **Global Accelerator's Unique Advantages**:
    
    - **Static IP Addresses**: Directly addresses the integration requirement with partners and third-party services by providing static IP addresses that can be whitelisted.
    - **Geographic Routing and Failover**: Optimizes application performance by routing traffic to the nearest operational endpoint, enhancing user experience, and ensuring high availability through automatic failover.
