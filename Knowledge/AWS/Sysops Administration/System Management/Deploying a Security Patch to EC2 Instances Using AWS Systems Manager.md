### Deploying a Security Patch to EC2 Instances Using AWS Systems Manager

#### Scenario Overview

A global company is faced with the challenge of deploying a security patch across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in response to a newly identified zero-day vulnerability. These instances are managed using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager and are tagged based on the operating system. The SysOps administrator is responsible for not only deploying the patch but also providing a report to confirm successful execution on each EC2 instance.

#### Possible Actions to Meet Requirements:

1. **Create a custom automation runbook for AWS Systems Manager Automation**:
    - **Approach**: Develop a runbook with actions to execute the security team's patch and log the command history to an S3 bucket.
2. **Manage instances using AWS CloudFormation**:
    - **Approach**: Utilize a CloudFormation template to create an S3 bucket and launch instances with UserData that includes the patch script and command to save logs to the S3 bucket.
3. **Utilize Systems Manager Run Command**:
    - **Approach**: Use either the `AWS-RunShellScript` document for Linux or `AWS-RunPowerShellScript` document for Windows. Input the security team's patch script, target the instances by operating system tags, and utilize command history for evidence.
4. **Create an AWS Lambda function for SSH connections to EC2 instances**:
    - **Approach**: Program a Lambda function to SSH into EC2 instances, check the operating system via tags, execute the patch, and log results to an S3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to query the results.

#### Optimal Solution

**Utilize Systems Manager Run Command**:

- **Why Correct**: This method offers a direct and efficient way to execute scripts across multiple instances, leveraging Systems Manager's native capabilities for immediate action without needing access to the instance's operating system directly. It enables targeting specific instances based on tags (e.g., operating system), ensuring the right script is executed on the appropriate instances. The command history provides a built-in reporting mechanism to verify execution success, aligning perfectly with the requirement to produce a deployment report.

#### Analysis of Other Methods

1. **AWS Systems Manager Automation Runbook**:
    
    - **Why Ineffective**: While automation runbooks are powerful for sequence actions, they **introduce complexity for tasks that can be achieved more straightforwardly with Run Command**. Additionally, creating a new runbook and ensuring its correctness under time pressure might not be ideal.
2. **AWS CloudFormation**:
    
    - **Why Ineffective**: Managing instances via CloudFormation for patch deployment is indirect and cumbersome. It involves unnecessary steps like creating S3 buckets through templates and handling instance UserData, which is not as efficient for rapid patch deployment across existing instances.
3. **AWS Lambda with SSH**:
    
    - **Why Ineffective**: Using Lambda to SSH into instances introduces unnecessary complexity and security considerations (managing SSH keys). It also requires custom coding to handle different operating systems and logging results, which is less efficient compared to using built-in Systems Manager capabilities.

#### Key Insights

- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Systems Manager Run Command is specifically designed for executing commands across multiple instances efficiently, making it ideal for deploying urgent security patches.
- **Targeting and Reporting**: The ability to target instances based on tags and automatically log command execution history simplifies compliance with the deployment and reporting requirements.
- **Simplicity**: Avoiding the overhead of custom scripts, SSH management, or CloudFormation stacks for patch deployment ensures a faster response to security vulnerabilities.
