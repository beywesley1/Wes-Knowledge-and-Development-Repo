### CloudFormation Template for EC2 Instance Launch and Application Installation

A commercial bank is transitioning to AWS for application hosting and requires a CloudFormation template that automates the launch of a large On-Demand EC2 instance and installs a 3rd-party application package. The template must also handle the signaling back to AWS CloudFormation to indicate whether the installation was successful or failed.

#### Options for Signaling Installation Success or Failure:

1. **Use the cfn-signal and cfn-init helper scripts.**
2. **Use the cfn-init helper script to install the third-party package and send notification back to AWS CloudFormation.**
3. **Use the cfn-get-metadata and cfn-init helper scripts.**
4. **Use the cfn-hup and cfn-init helper scripts.**

#### Correct Option Explanation:

**Use the cfn-signal and cfn-init helper scripts**:

- **Why Correct**: The `cfn-init` script is used to **fetch and interpret resource metadata, install packages, create files, and start services**. This script will **handle the installation of the third-party application package**. The `cfn-signal` script is then used to **signal AWS CloudFormation directly once the application is installed or if the installation fails**. This is the desired behavior according to the bank's requirements, as it allows CloudFormation to wait for the success signal before proceeding with the stack creation or handling failure accordingly.

#### Incorrect Options and Their Explanations:

1. **cfn-init Only**:
    
    - **Why Incorrect**: While the `cfn-init` script can install the application package, **it does not by itself signal the success or failure of the installation back to AWS CloudFormation**. The signal is crucial for orchestrating the deployment process based on the success or failure of the application installation.
2. **cfn-get-metadata and cfn-init**:
    
    - **Why Incorrect**: The `cfn-get-metadata` script is used to retrieve metadata for a resource within a CloudFormation template. Although it's useful in conjunction with `cfn-init`, it **doesn't facilitate signaling CloudFormation about the success or failure of the installation process**, which is a crucial part of the requirement.
3. **cfn-hup and cfn-init**:
    
    - **Why Incorrect**: The `cfn-hup` script is a daemon to check for updates to metadata and execute custom hooks when changes are detected. This script **does not signal AWS CloudFormation about the success or failure of an installation**. It is more suited for ongoing management of an instance after the stack has been created and **is not relevant for the initial installation signaling**.

The administrator must use both `cfn-init` to manage the application installation and `cfn-signal` to communicate the outcome back to CloudFormation. This combination ensures that the CloudFormation template can correctly manage the lifecycle of the stack based on the success or failure of the EC2 instance setup and application installation.
