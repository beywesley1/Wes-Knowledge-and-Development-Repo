### DNS Resolution Scenario Between On-premises and AWS

#### Scenario Overview

A company is integrating two essential applications: one hosted on-premises with the hostname `example.local` and the other running on an Amazon EC2 instance with the hostname `example.aws-cloud`. They are connected via AWS Direct Connect, but the on-premises application cannot resolve the DNS of the EC2 instance, indicating a DNS resolution failure.

#### Proposed Solutions

1. **Configure an Amazon Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint for the VPC, directing aws-cloud private DNS queries from on-premises to this endpoint.**
2. **Configure an Amazon Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint for the VPC, directing aws-cloud private DNS queries from on-premises to this endpoint.**
3. **Configure an Amazon Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint for the VPC, directing local private DNS queries from AWS to the on-premises network.**
4. **Configure an Amazon Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint for the VPC, directing local private DNS queries from on-premises toward this endpoint.**

#### Correct Solution

- **Configure an Amazon Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint for the VPC where the EC2 instance is hosted, and configure the on-premises DNS resolver to direct aws-cloud private DNS queries toward the newly established inbound resolver endpoint.**

### Explanation of the Correct Choice

#### Route 53 Resolver Inbound Endpoint

- **Why It's Valid:** An inbound endpoint in Amazon Route 53 Resolver **facilitates DNS queries from external sources** (in this case, the on-premises network) **to AWS**. By setting up an inbound endpoint within the VPC of the EC2 instance and configuring the on-premises DNS resolver to forward DNS queries for the `aws-cloud` domain to this endpoint, DNS resolution from on-premises to AWS can be achieved. This solution directly addresses the challenge by bridging the DNS resolution gap between the on-premises environment and AWS.

### Explanation of Incorrect Choices

1. **Outbound Endpoint for aws-cloud Queries:**
    
    - **Why It's Incorrect:** An outbound resolver endpoint is designed for DNS queries originating from within AWS to reach external DNS servers. Since the problem involves resolving the DNS of an AWS resource from an on-premises network, configuring an outbound endpoint does not address the issue.
2. **Outbound Endpoint for local private Queries:**
    
    - **Why It's Incorrect:** This setup incorrectly assumes the need to resolve on-premises DNS names from AWS, which is not the issue described. The challenge is the opposite: resolving an AWS resource's DNS from on-premises.
3. **Inbound Endpoint for local private Queries:**
    
    - **Why It's Incorrect:** Directing local private DNS queries towards an AWS inbound resolver endpoint does not solve the problem because the issue lies with resolving the `example.aws-cloud` hostname from the on-premises network, not resolving on-premises hostnames within AWS.

### Outbound Resolver Endpoints

- **Purpose:** Outbound Resolver Endpoints are used when you need to resolve DNS names located outside of your AWS environment from within AWS. For example, if your applications hosted in AWS need to access external services (like SaaS platforms, external APIs, etc.), the outbound resolver facilitates this by forwarding DNS queries from AWS to the external DNS servers.
- **Use Case Simplified:** AWS → External DNS resolution.

### Inbound Resolver Endpoints

- **Purpose:** Inbound Resolver Endpoints are designed for the opposite scenario. When external systems need to resolve DNS names of resources within AWS (like EC2 instances, databases, etc.), the inbound resolver comes into play by forwarding DNS queries from external networks into AWS.
- **Use Case Simplified:** External → AWS DNS resolution.

#### Mnemonic to Remember

To easily recall which is which, think of the direction from where the DNS query starts:

- **Outbound (AWS → External):** Think of "Outbound" as "Out of AWS." If the need is to reach out from AWS to the world, use an Outbound Resolver.
- **Inbound (External → AWS):** Conversely, think of "Inbound" as "Into AWS." If external requests need to find their way into AWS, an Inbound Resolver is your go-to.
