  
### Blocking Malicious Traffic to an EC2 Web Application
#### Scenario Overview

A web application operates on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) within an Auto Scaling group. The SysOps Administrator needs to address the challenge of malicious traffic originating from a specific public IP address, seeking an efficient method to block this traffic without disrupting the normal operation of the application.

#### Objective

To devise a strategy that successfully blocks the identified malicious traffic source, thereby protecting the web application's integrity and ensuring its continuous, secure functionality.

#### Possible Solutions:

1. **Create an NACL rule to deny all inbound traffic from the public IP address and associate the ALB with the NACL**:
    - Implements subnet-level traffic filtering by modifying the Network Access Control List (NACL) to block the specified IP address.
2. **Create an IP set that includes the public IP address. Configure a web ACL with a rule set to BLOCK the IP set in AWS WAF. Associate the ALB with the web ACL**:
    - Utilizes AWS WAF to create a web access control list (ACL) that specifically blocks requests from the identified IP address, applying this rule directly to the traffic handled by the ALB.
3. **Utilize Amazon Detective to prevent malicious activity from the internet and monitor the traffic. Associate the ALB with Amazon Detective**:
    - Engages Amazon Detective to analyze traffic patterns and investigate the source of malicious activity, aiming to block it indirectly.
4. **Utilize AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to administer traffic rules and block malicious activity from the internet. Associate the ALB with AWS RAM**:
    - Applies AWS RAM to manage and share network resources with the intention of blocking malicious traffic at the resource level.

#### Correct Solution

**Create an IP set that includes the public IP address. Configure a web ACL with a rule set to BLOCK the IP set in AWS WAF. Associate the ALB with the web ACL**:

- **Correct because:**
    - AWS WAF is specifically designed for web application security, allowing administrators to create custom web access control lists (ACLs) that target and mitigate specific threats. By creating an IP set to block and associating this rule with the ALB, SysOps Administrators can precisely target the malicious IP without impacting other users. This method offers the necessary granularity for application-level security, ensuring that only the malicious traffic is blocked. AWS WAF's integration with ALB allows for real-time traffic analysis and blocking, providing a robust defense mechanism that can be dynamically adjusted as threats evolve.

#### Incorrect Solutions

**Create an NACL rule to deny all inbound traffic from the public IP address and associate the ALB with the NACL**:

- **Incorrect because:**
    - NACLs provide a broad level of traffic control that is applied at the subnet level, not directly to individual AWS services such as ALBs. While NACLs can be effective for blocking IP addresses, their stateless nature and subnet-wide impact can lead to unintended consequences, such as blocking legitimate traffic or failing to provide the granularity needed for specific web application protection. Moreover, ALBs cannot be directly associated with NACLs; the association is indirect through the subnet, leading to potential overblocking or underblocking.

**Utilize Amazon Detective to prevent malicious activity from the internet and monitor the traffic. Associate the ALB with Amazon Detective**:

- **Incorrect because:**
         - Amazon Detective is a security analysis service that is used primarily for investigating and analyzing security incidents after they have occurred. While it is powerful for identifying patterns of malicious activity and understanding the nature of security threats, it does not offer real-time blocking capabilities. Detective can help in understanding the attack vectors and possibly identifying the source of malicious traffic, but it cannot directly block an IP address or mitigate an attack in progress. It is more of a post-incident tool rather than a preventive measure.

**Utilize AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to administer traffic rules and block malicious activity from the internet. Associate the ALB with AWS RAM**:

- **Incorrect because:**
        - AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) is designed for sharing AWS resources across AWS accounts securely. Its primary use case is in scenarios where organizations need to share resources like Subnets, Transits Gateways, and others within their organization or with external parties while maintaining control and governance. AWS RAM does not provide traffic filtering, IP blocking capabilities, or direct integration with ALB for security purposes. It is not suitable for addressing specific web application security concerns like blocking malicious IP addresses.
