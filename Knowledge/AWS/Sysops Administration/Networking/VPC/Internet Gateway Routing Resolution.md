#### Scenario Overview

A SysOps Administrator has set up a new VPC with a /16 IPv4 CIDR block, including a /24 subnet. An On-Demand EC2 instance equipped with an NGINX AMI intended for hosting a WordPress website has been launched within this VPC. Despite configuring the security group to allow inbound SSH traffic on port 22 and adding an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC, the Administrator is unable to establish an SSH connection to the instance. The main route table includes two entries, both targeting the same destination CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16) but with different targets, including the local VPC and the IGW.

#### Possible Solutions

1. Change the destination of the local target to 0.0.0.0/0.
2. Attach an Elastic IP to the Instance.
3. Attach a NAT gateway to the VPC.
4. Change the destination of the IGW to 0.0.0.0/0.

#### Correct Solution

- **Change the destination of the IGW to 0.0.0.0/0:** This solution correctly configures the route table to forward all outbound traffic not destined for the local VPC network to the Internet Gateway, allowing the EC2 instance to communicate with the internet and vice versa. This is essential for enabling SSH access from an external network to the EC2 instance.

### Explanation of Incorrect Choices

1. **Change the destination of the local target to 0.0.0.0/0:**
    
    - **Why It's Incorrect:** The local route for 10.0.0.0/16 is necessary to enable communication within the VPC itself. Changing its destination to 0.0.0.0/0 would not make sense, as it would imply that all traffic, regardless of destination, should be routed within the VPC, neglecting the need for external communication through the IGW.
2. **Attach an Elastic IP to the Instance:**
    
    - **Why It's Incorrect:** While attaching an Elastic IP to the instance is a step in the right direction for allowing the instance to be accessed from the internet, it alone does not resolve the issue if the route table does not correctly route outbound traffic to the internet via the IGW. An Elastic IP allows the instance to have a public IP address, but correct routing is still required for successful inbound connections.
3. **Attach a NAT gateway to the VPC:**
    
    - **Why It's Incorrect:** A NAT gateway is used to enable instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the internet or other AWS services but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. Since the goal is to enable inbound SSH connections to the EC2 instance (presumably in a public subnet since it involves an Internet Gateway), a NAT gateway does not address the issue.
