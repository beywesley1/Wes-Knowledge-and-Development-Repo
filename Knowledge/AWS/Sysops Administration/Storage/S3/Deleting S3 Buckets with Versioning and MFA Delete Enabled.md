### Deleting S3 Buckets with Versioning and MFA Delete Enabled

#### Scenario Overview

During the annual AWS data cleanup, there's a need to delete all unused Amazon S3 buckets, including the `example1` bucket which stores educational video files. This bucket has both Versioning and MFA Delete features enabled, complicating the deletion process. An attempt to delete this bucket using the AWS CLI command `aws s3 rb s3://example1` failed, even with an Administrator account involved.

#### Available Options for Bucket Deletion:

1. **Use the `aws s3 rb s3://example1` command again with an additional `--force` option**.
2. **Use the AWS SDK to send deletion requests to S3, including the `x-amz-mfa` header for MFA authentication**.
3. **Remove the policy that requires MFA Delete on your S3 bucket and use the AWS SDK to remove all delete markers and object versions before attempting deletion again**.
4. **Delete all markers from the S3 bucket, then rerun the `aws s3 rb s3://example1` command**.
5. **Have the root account owner suspend MFA and versioning in the bucket, configure a lifecycle rule to manage object versions, then delete the bucket**.

#### Objective

To successfully delete the `example1` bucket and its contents, considering the enabled Versioning and MFA Delete features.

#### Valid Options for Bucket Deletion:

1. **Remove the policy that requires MFA Delete on your S3 bucket. Use the AWS SDK to remove all of the bucket's delete markers and object versions. Delete the bucket again using the same CLI command that you used before**.
2. **Have the root account owner suspend MFA and versioning in the bucket. Configure a lifecycle rule to expire current object versions and permanently remove non-current object versions. Permanently purge all objects and delete markers then delete your bucket again**.

#### Why These Are Correct:

1. **Removing MFA Delete Requirement and Clearing Versions**:
    
    - MFA Delete adds an additional layer of security by requiring MFA to change the versioning state or delete versioned objects. Removing this requirement simplifies the deletion process.
    - Using the AWS SDK to programmatically remove all object versions and delete markers addresses the challenge posed by versioning. Only after clearing all versions can the bucket be deleted, aligning with S3's requirement for an empty bucket before deletion.
2. **Suspending Versioning and Using Lifecycle Rules**:
    
    - Suspending versioning stops the creation of new versions, making it easier to manage the existing objects.
    - Configuring lifecycle rules to expire and permanently remove object versions automates the cleanup process, effectively emptying the bucket over time. Once all objects and versions are cleared, the bucket can be deleted without errors.

#### Explanation of Incorrect Options:

1. **Forcibly Deleting the Bucket via CLI**:
    
    - The `--force` option does indeed delete a bucket and all its contents. However, when MFA Delete is enabled, this operation won't bypass the MFA requirement, leading to a failure in deletion attempts.
2. **Using AWS SDK with MFA Header for Deletion**:
    
    - While including the `x-amz-mfa` header is necessary for operations requiring MFA, simply sending deletion requests doesn't automatically handle the complexities of deleting versioned objects and delete markers in a bucket with MFA Delete enabled.
3. **Deleting All Markers with CLI Command**:
    
    - Manually deleting all markers and versions via the CLI without suspending the versioning or MFA Delete features does not directly address the underlying requirement of emptying the bucket before deletion.
