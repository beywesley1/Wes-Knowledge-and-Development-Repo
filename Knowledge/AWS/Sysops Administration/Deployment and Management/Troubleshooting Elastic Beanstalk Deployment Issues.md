### Troubleshooting Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Issues

#### Scenario Brief:

A former colleague, now working on deploying a new web application using Django, reached out for consultation regarding a deployment issue encountered with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. While attempting to upload and deploy the Django project via the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (CLI), he was faced with a roadblock. The error message presented was “The instance profile `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` associated with the environment does not exist.” This issue has halted the progress of creating the necessary environment for the project, leaving the colleague puzzled about the underlying cause.

#### Potential Causes of the Issue:

1. **Instance profile container for the role needs to be manually replaced every time a new environment is launched**.
    
2. **Elastic Beanstalk CLI did not create one because your IAM role has no permission to create roles**.
    
3. **You have not associated an Elastic Beanstalk role to your CLI**.
    
4. **He selected the wrong platform for the Django code**.
    
5. **IAM role already exists but has insufficient permissions that Elastic Beanstalk needs**.

#### Correct Causes and Explanation:

- **Elastic Beanstalk CLI did not create one because your IAM role has no permission to create roles**:
    - This is a common issue when the IAM user or role that executes the Elastic Beanstalk CLI lacks the necessary permissions to create or manage IAM roles or instance profiles. **Elastic Beanstalk requires specific roles for its operations**, and if the executing user/role cannot create these resources, it will lead to the mentioned error.
- **IAM role already exists but has insufficient permissions that Elastic Beanstalk needs**:
    - Even if the `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` exists, **it must have the correct permissions to support the Elastic Beanstalk environment's requirements**. If the role lacks necessary permissions, Elastic Beanstalk operations can fail, leading to errors during environment creation or deployment.

#### Analysis of Other Options:

- **Instance profile container for the role needs to be manually replaced every time a new environment is launched**:
    - This statement is incorrect because Elastic Beanstalk automatically manages the instance profiles and roles as part of the environment creation process. Manual replacement of instance profiles for each new environment is not a standard requirement.
- **You have not associated an Elastic Beanstalk role to your CLI**:
    - While associating an IAM role with the CLI can be necessary for certain operations, the specific error message about the instance profile not existing is more directly related to the permissions of the IAM role being used rather than the association of the role with the CLI itself.
- **He selected the wrong platform for the Django code**:
    - Selecting the wrong platform version can cause deployment issues, but it would not result in an error message regarding the non-existence of an instance profile. This cause is unrelated to the IAM or instance profile configurations.
