### Automating EC2 Instance Recovery and Notification for SysOps Teams

#### Objective:

A SysOps team aims to enhance their infrastructure's resilience by automating the recovery process for Amazon EC2 instances experiencing underlying hardware failures. To maintain network configurations seamlessly, it's crucial that the Elastic IP and private IP addresses of the original instance are preserved post-recovery. Moreover, ensuring the team is promptly informed when a recovery process initiates is essential for maintaining operational awareness and readiness.

#### Strategy Overview:

1. **Amazon SNS Topic Creation**:
    
    - **Action**: Establish an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic dedicated to this automation process.
    - **Purpose**: To facilitate the dispatch of automated email notifications to the SysOps team, keeping them informed about the initiation of recovery processes.
    - **Details**: All SysOps team members are subscribed to this topic using their corporate email addresses, enabling immediate and direct communication.
2. **Amazon CloudWatch Alarm Configuration**:
    
    - **Metric Chosen**: `StatusCheckFailed_System`.
    - **Rationale**: This metric is specifically designed to identify and alert on failures related to the EC2 instance's underlying hardware, which are critical triggers for the intended recovery process.
    - **Execution**: Upon detecting a system-level issue indicative of hardware failure, the CloudWatch alarm activates, signaling a need for instance recovery to maintain service continuity and performance.
3. **Alarm Notification Setup**:
    
    - **Implementation**: Configure the CloudWatch alarm to automatically publish a message to the SNS topic upon activation.
    - **Outcome**: This ensures that every member of the SysOps team receives an immediate notification, via email, alerting them to the recovery process's initiation. This step is vital for maintaining situational awareness and allows for any necessary follow-up actions.

#### Justification for the Approach:

- **Targeted Monitoring**: Utilizing the `StatusCheckFailed_System` metric for CloudWatch alarms focuses the monitoring efforts on detecting underlying hardware issues. This precision is key to triggering recovery processes only when genuinely needed, thereby preserving the instance's network configuration, including its Elastic and private IP addresses.
    
- **Efficient Communication**: Linking the CloudWatch alarm directly to an SNS topic for immediate notification streamlines communication. It ensures that the SysOps team is quickly made aware of any initiated recovery processes, enabling a swift response if additional intervention is required.

#### Contrast with Other Methods:

- The alternative approach, involving the `StatusCheckFailed_Instance` metric, broadens the scope of monitoring to include both system and application-level issues. While comprehensive, it isn't as finely tuned to the specific objective of detecting and responding to underlying hardware failures. This distinction makes the `StatusCheckFailed_System` metric and its associated processes the more apt choice for scenarios prioritizing hardware failure recovery and the retention of IP configurations.
