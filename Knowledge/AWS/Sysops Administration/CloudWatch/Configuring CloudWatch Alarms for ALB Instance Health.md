### Configuring CloudWatch Alarms for ALB Instance Health

#### Scenario Overview

An application is operational in the `us-east-1` region, utilizing Amazon EC2 instances grouped within an Auto Scaling Group named `asg-prod`. These instances are managed by an Application Load Balancer (ALB), which distributes incoming traffic from Route 53 based on the health of the instances. The SysOps Administrator is tasked with ensuring the high availability of the application by setting up a CloudWatch alarm to notify when all instances behind the ALB become unhealthy.

#### Objective

To establish a CloudWatch alarm that triggers under the precise condition where all EC2 instances behind the ALB are marked as unhealthy, enabling quick detection and resolution to avoid application downtime.

#### Possible Alarm Conditions:

1. **Use AWS/ApplicationELB UnhealthyHostCount >= 1**
2. **Use AWS/ApplicationELB HealthyHostCount <= 0**
3. **Use AWS/EC2 StatusCheckFailed <= 0**
4. **Use AWS/EC2 StatusCheckFailedInstance >= 1**

#### Correct Alarm Configuration:

- **Use AWS/ApplicationELB HealthyHostCount <= 0**:
    - This condition is optimal for detecting when there are no healthy instances left behind the ALB, indicating a complete outage or unavailability of the application to handle incoming traffic.

#### Explanation of the Correct Choice:

- **Directly Addresses Scenario Requirements**: The HealthyHostCount metric being less than or equal to 0 precisely indicates that all instances are unhealthy, matching the SysOps Administrator's need to be alerted in such critical situations.

#### Explanation of Incorrect Options:

1. **AWS/ApplicationELB UnhealthyHostCount >= 1**:
    
    - This metric triggers an alarm when one or more instances become unhealthy. It's not suitable for the specific requirement, as the application can still be operational if other instances remain healthy.
2. **AWS/EC2 StatusCheckFailed <= 0**:
    
    - Monitoring for instances with zero or less status check failures is not logical for alarm conditions, as this would typically indicate a normal, healthy state, not a scenario warranting an alarm.
3. **AWS/EC2 StatusCheckFailedInstance >= 1**:
    
    - This condition focuses on individual EC2 instances with status check failures. While indicative of potential issues, it doesn't accurately reflect the health of instances specifically behind the ALB or guarantee that all instances are affected, which is necessary for this scenario.
