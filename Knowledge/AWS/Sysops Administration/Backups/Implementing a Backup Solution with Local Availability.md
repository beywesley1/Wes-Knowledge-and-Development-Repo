### Implementing a Backup Solution with Local Availability for a Finance Organization

#### Scenario Overview

A finance organization aims to leverage AWS for backing up its critical data currently stored in an on-premises data center. The manager mandates that the backup data must also be available locally to adhere to regulatory requirements. Additionally, the organization's backup software necessitates block-based storage that is POSIX-compatible.

#### Objective

To identify a backup solution that allows for the storage of backup data on AWS while ensuring local availability to meet regulatory compliance.

#### Proposed Backup Solutions:

1. **Utilize AWS Storage Gateway and configure it to operate using stored volumes**.
2. **Configure the backup software to target Amazon S3 Glacier for data backups**.
3. **Utilize AWS Storage Gateway and configure it to use cached volumes**.
4. **Configure the backup software to target an Amazon S3 bucket for the data backups**.

#### Optimal Solution

**Utilize AWS Storage Gateway and configure it to operate using stored volumes**:

- **Rationale**: AWS Storage Gateway in the stored volumes mode allows organizations to store their data in on-premises storage hardware while asynchronously backing up that data to AWS. This configuration provides block storage volumes that are accessible through a standard iSCSI interface, ensuring compatibility with the POSIX requirements of the backup software. The primary advantage of this approach is the local retention of the entire dataset, satisfying the regulatory requirement for local data availability, while still leveraging AWS for backups.

#### Analysis of Other Methods

1. **Amazon S3 Glacier**:
    
    - **Why Ineffective**: Direct backups to Amazon S3 Glacier, while cost-effective for long-term storage, do not provide immediate local availability of the data. S3 Glacier is designed for archival purposes and does not support the POSIX-compatibility required by the organization's backup software.
2. **AWS Storage Gateway with Cached Volumes**:
    
    - **Why Ineffective**: Cached volumes store the primary data in AWS, with only a subset of frequently accessed data cached locally. This approach might not fully comply with the regulatory requirements for local availability of all backup data.
3. **Amazon S3 Bucket**:
    
    - **Why Ineffective**: Although backing up data directly to an Amazon S3 bucket can be straightforward and supports various data types, it does not inherently offer local data availability or the block-based, POSIX-compatible storage required by the backup software.

#### Key Insights

- **Local vs. Cloud Data Availability**: The primary criterion for the organization's backup solution is the ability to maintain local availability of backup data to meet regulatory requirements, a feature uniquely offered by the stored volumes configuration of AWS Storage Gateway.
- **Compliance with Backup Software Requirements**: Compatibility with the organization's existing backup software, specifically the need for block-based, POSIX-compatible storage, is critical. Stored volumes via AWS Storage Gateway provide an iSCSI interface that meets these requirements.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards is paramount for finance organizations. The stored volumes configuration allows for the backup data to be stored locally and in AWS, offering redundancy and accessibility that align with stringent compliance mandates.
