#### Scenario Overview

A document management system hosted on AWS utilizes an S3 bucket for data storage. Following a cyberattack, the IT Security department has mandated encryption at rest for all objects in the S3 bucket to enhance data security and protect sensitive information.

1. **Use AWS server-side encryption for the S3 bucket with AWS Managed Keys (SSE-S3).**
2. **Use AWS server-side encryption for the S3 bucket with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).**
3. **Use the S3 Bucket Policy to automatically encrypt all objects.**
4. **Use the Access Control List (ACL) of the bucket to encrypt all objects in the S3 bucket.**
5. **Enable CORS in the S3 bucket.**

### Explanation of Valid Choices

#### 1. AWS Server-Side Encryption with AWS Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

- **Why It's Valid:** AWS provides server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) as a straightforward method to encrypt data at rest. When this option is enabled, every object is automatically encrypted as it is written to the bucket, and decrypted when it's accessed. The encryption, decryption, and key management are all handled seamlessly by AWS, requiring minimal effort from the user.

#### 2. AWS Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)

- **Why It's Valid:** SSE-C allows users to leverage the server-side encryption feature of S3 but with an added layer of control over the encryption keys. Here, the customer provides the encryption key as part of the upload request, and AWS manages the encryption process. This option gives users more control over their keys while still utilizing AWS's robust encryption mechanisms.

### Explanation of Incorrect Choices

#### Use the S3 Bucket Policy to Automatically Encrypt All Objects

- **Why It's Incorrect:** While S3 bucket policies are powerful for managing access to bucket resources, they **cannot enforce server-side encryption directly**. Encryption needs to be specified either at the object level during upload or configured as **a default bucket setting**, not through bucket policies.

#### Use the Access Control List (ACL) of the Bucket to Encrypt All Objects in the S3 Bucket

- **Why It's Incorrect:** ACLs are used to **manage permissions on individual objects or buckets**. They **do not have the capability to enforce encryption**. Encryption settings are not part of ACL configurations.

#### Enable CORS in the S3 Bucket

- **Why It's Incorrect:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows or restricts requested resources on a web server depending on where the HTTP request was initiated. It is unrelated to data encryption or security standards regarding data at rest. CORS settings would not impact the encryption status of objects stored within an S3 bucket.
