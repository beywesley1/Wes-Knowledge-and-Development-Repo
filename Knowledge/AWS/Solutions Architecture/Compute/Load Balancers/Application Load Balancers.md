### WebSockets and Application Load Balancers

WebSockets provide a way to establish a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. This technology is designed to facilitate real-time data exchange, enabling servers to push updates to clients as soon as new data becomes available, without the need for clients to make repeated HTTP requests.

#### What are WebSockets?

WebSockets are a protocol, distinct from HTTP, but compatible with HTTP. They enable a more interactive communication session between the user's browser (or another client) and a server. After a handshake over HTTP, the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection, which allows for bidirectional data flow.

#### How They Work

1. **Handshake**: The WebSocket connection starts as an HTTP request from the client to the server, including headers that request an "Upgrade" to WebSockets.
2. **Connection Upgrade**: If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with a confirmation of the protocol upgrade. From this point on, the connection remains open, and the protocol switches from HTTP to WebSockets.
3. **Data Transfer**: Through this open connection, data can be sent back and forth between the client and server in real-time, with minimal overhead, allowing for low latency communication.

#### Use Cases

- **Real-Time Applications**: Chat applications, live sports updates, real-time trading platforms, and any application requiring instant updates without the need for reloading or polling.
- **Gaming**: Multiplayer online games where players' actions need to be reflected in real-time to all other players.
- **Notifications**: Sending instant notifications or alerts to users as soon as an event occurs.

#### Why an Application that requires WebSockets Needs an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

An application that requires WebSockets for real-time data streaming, host-based and path-based routing to direct requests to different parts of the application, and support for containerized applications to ensure scalability and efficient resource use would benefit from using an ALB as opposed to other types of Load Balancers offered by AWS. Here's why an ALB is essential:

- **Support for WebSockets**: **ALBs inherently support WebSockets**, which is crucial for the real-time bidirectional communication needed in real time data streaming platforms. This ensures that users receive instant updates on data fluctuations.
- **Advanced Routing**: ALBs provide advanced routing capabilities, such as host-based and path-based routing, allowing requests to be forwarded to different services based on the URL. This is useful for directing traffic to specific microservices within a real-time data streaming platform, such as different components for account management, executions, and real-time data feeds.
- **High Availability and Scalability**: ALBs are designed to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Docker containers, in multiple Availability Zones, which increases the availability and scalability of the application. This is essential for real-time data streaming platforms, such as forex trading applications, which must handle high volumes of concurrent requests and maintain high availability to process trades without delays.
- **Containerized Application Support**: ALBs are well-suited for applications deployed in containers. They can dynamically adjust to the changing number of instances or containers, ensuring efficient load distribution and the seamless scaling of resources in response to varying loads, which is vital for the performance and reliability of forex trading platforms.

In contrast, other types of load balancers, like traditional network load balancers (NLBs) or classic load balancers, might not offer the same level of application-aware routing capabilities, **direct support for WebSockets**, or the flexibility needed for efficiently managing containerized applications. ALBs are specifically **designed to understand and manage application-level traffic**, making them the optimal choice for complex, real-time, and microservices-based applications.
