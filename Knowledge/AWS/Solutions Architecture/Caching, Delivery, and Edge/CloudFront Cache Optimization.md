### Optimizing Cache Hit Ratio

Improving the cache hit ratio involves strategies that increase the likelihood of serving requests directly from the cache, thereby reducing the need to fetch data from the origin server. Two effective strategies are configuring the origin to add a Cache-Control max-age directive and fine-tuning the cache behavior settings.

#### Adding Cache-Control Max-Age Directive

The `Cache-Control max-age` directive plays a pivotal role in content caching strategies. This response header specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that a resource will be considered fresh. By configuring your origin server to include a `Cache-Control max-age` directive with your objects, you instruct CloudFront and other intermediate caches about **how long to store the cached version of the object**.

Setting the longest practical value for `max-age` increases the time-to-live (TTL) of cached objects, which means that once an object is cached,**it will be served from the cache for a longer period before CloudFront checks with the origin server for an updated version**. This approach **can significantly boost the cache hit ratio as more requests are satisfied directly from the cache**, reducing latency and decreasing the load on the origin server.

#### Configuring Cache Behavior Settings

In the cache behavior settings of your CloudFront distribution, you have the option to specify which query string parameters CloudFront forwards to the origin. By default, CloudFront caches separate versions of an object based on all query string parameters. However, configuring CloudFront to forward **only the query string parameters that are required for your origin to return unique objects can dramatically increase your cache hit ratio**.

This fine-tuning ensures that CloudFront caches objects more efficiently by not creating unnecessary cache variations. If your application doesn't use specific query parameters to deliver different content, not forwarding these parameters can prevent the dilution of your cache and improve cache effectiveness.
