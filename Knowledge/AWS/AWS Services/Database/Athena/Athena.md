**Amazon Athena** is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there's no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries you run.
### How It Works

1. **Serverless Architecture**: Athena is serverless. You don't need to manage any infrastructure or do any setup, scaling, or patching. You can start querying data instantly.
    
2. **Data on S3**: Athena uses the data stored in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your data within S3 and start using SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.
    
3. **Standard SQL**: Athena uses Presto, an open-source SQL query engine optimized for low latency and parallel processing, allowing you to use standard SQL to query your data.
    
4. **Schema on Read**: Unlike traditional databases where you have to define schemas before inserting data, with Athena, you define the schema when you're ready to query. This is known as "schema on read."
    
5. **Integrated with AWS Glue**: AWS Glue's data catalog is integrated with Athena, making it easy to create tables, define schemas, and optimize query performance.

### Use Cases

1. **Log Analysis**: Quickly query logs stored in S3, whether they're application logs, CloudTrail logs, or VPC Flow Logs.
    
2. **Ad-hoc Data Exploration**: If you have datasets dumped in S3 and you want to quickly explore them without setting up a database, Athena is perfect.
    
3. **Data Lake Queries**: For organizations that have set up a data lake architecture on S3, Athena provides a way to run queries without moving data around.
    
4. **Generating Reports**: You can use Athena to generate regular reports, integrating it with visualization tools like Amazon QuickSight or Tableau.

### Basic Things to Know

1. **Cost**: With Athena, you pay per query. It's important to note that you're billed based on the amount of data scanned by the query, not the amount of data returned. This means optimizing your queries and compressing, partitioning, or converting your data into columnar formats can save costs.
    
2. **Performance**: Athena's performance can be optimized by partitioning data, using columnar formats like Parquet or ORC, and compressing your data.
    
3. **Concurrent Queries**: Athena allows you to run concurrent queries, but there's a limit to how many you can run simultaneously. If you hit the limit, additional queries are queued.
    
4. **Saved Queries**: You can save queries in Athena, making it easy to rerun frequent analyses.
    
5. **Security**: Athena integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing you to set permissions and control access to your data.
    
6. **Data Formats**: Athena supports a variety of data formats, including CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, and more.

#### Example Scenario:

Imagine you're running a large e-commerce platform, and every transaction, click, and user interaction is logged and stored in S3 in JSON format. Over time, this amounts to terabytes of data. You want to analyze user behavior, understand sales trends, and get insights into your data without setting up complex databases.

With Athena, you can simply point to your logs in S3, define a schema that matches your logs, and start running SQL queries. Want to know the most popular products in the last month? Or understand user behavior leading to a sale? Just write a SQL query and get your results in seconds.

### Athena In-Depth

Athena uses a **schema-on-read** strategy to query data stored in S3.

#### Schema-on-Read:

**Schema-on-read** is a data processing strategy in which you define the schema for your data at the time you read it, rather than when you write it. This is in contrast to the traditional "schema-on-write" approach used by relational databases, where you define the schema before inserting data.

In traditional SQL databases, before you can insert or write data into the database, you need to define a schema. This schema specifies the structure of the data, including tables, columns, data types, relationships, constraints, etc. This approach is known as **schema-on-write**.

**Characteristics of Schema-on-Write**:

1. **Predefined Structure**: Before inserting data, you need to define tables, columns, and their data types.
2. **Consistency**: Data must conform to the schema when it's written. If it doesn't, the write operation will fail.
3. **Less Flexibility**: Changing the schema often requires altering the database, which can be complex and time-consuming.
##### Example 1: Schema-on-Write (Traditional SQL Database)

**Scenario**: You're building a system for a bookstore. Before you can start entering book data into your SQL database, you need to define the structure of your data.

1. **Define the Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255),
    Author VARCHAR(255),
    PublishedDate DATE,
    Price DECIMAL(5,2)
);
```
###### Explanation:

**`CREATE TABLE Books`**:
    - This command is used to create a new table in the database.
    - `Books` is the name of the table.
**`BookID INT PRIMARY KEY`**:
    - `BookID`: This is the name of the column.
    - `INT`: This specifies that the data type of this column is an integer. It means this column will store whole numbers.
    - `PRIMARY KEY`: This indicates that the `BookID` column is the primary key for the table. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in the table. This means that every `BookID` must be unique; you can't have two books with the same `BookID`.
**`Title VARCHAR(255)`**:
    - `Title`: This is the name of the column.
    - `VARCHAR(255)`: This specifies that the data type of this column is a variable-length character string. The number `255` is the maximum length of the string that can be stored in this column. It means this column can store text up to 255 characters long.
**`Author VARCHAR(255)`**:
    - `Author`: This is the name of the column.
    - `VARCHAR(255)`: Similar to the `Title` column, this column will store the author's name as a text string, with a maximum length of 255 characters.
**`PublishedDate DATE`**:
    - `PublishedDate`: This is the name of the column.
    - `DATE`: This specifies that the data type of this column is a date. It will store dates in a format like `YYYY-MM-DD`.
**`Price DECIMAL(5,2)`**:
    - `Price`: This is the name of the column.
    - `DECIMAL(5,2)`: This specifies that the data type of this column is a decimal number. The number `5` is the total number of digits that can be stored, and `2` is the number of digits after the decimal point. For example, it can store values like `123.45` or `12.34` but not `1234.567`.

2. **Insert Data**: When you have a new book to add, you insert it into the database:
```sql
INSERT INTO Books (BookID, Title, Author, PublishedDate, Price)
VALUES (1, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', '1925-04-10', 10.99);
```
###### Explanation:

 **`INSERT INTO Books`**:
    - This command is used to insert (or add) a new record (or row) into the `Books` table.
**`(BookID, Title, Author, PublishedDate, Price)`**:
    - These are the column names in the `Books` table where we want to insert the data. It specifies the order in which data for each column should be provided in the `VALUES` clause.
**`VALUES`**:
    - This keyword is used to specify the data that we want to insert into the specified columns.
**`(1, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', '1925-04-10', 10.99)`**:
    - These are the actual values that we want to insert into the `Books` table.
        - `1`: This is the value for the `BookID` column. It's an integer representing the unique ID of the book.
        - `'The Great Gatsby'`: This is the value for the `Title` column. It's a string representing the title of the book.
        - `'F. Scott Fitzgerald'`: This is the value for the `Author` column. It's a string representing the name of the author of the book.
        - `'1925-04-10'`: This is the value for the `PublishedDate` column. It's a date representing when the book was published.
        - `10.99`: This is the value for the `Price` column. It's a decimal number representing the price of the book.

3. **Constraints**: If you try to insert data that doesn't match the schema (e.g., inserting text into the `Price` column), the database will throw an error.
##### Example 2: Schema-on-Read

**Scenario**: You have raw log data from a website stored in JSON format in an S3 bucket. Each log entry has a timestamp, user ID, and the URL they visited. Over time, additional data points, like user agent or referral URL, might be added to the logs.

**Steps**:

1. **Store Raw Data**: You continuously dump logs into the S3 bucket without defining a structure. A sample log might look like:
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2023-09-26T12:00:00Z",
    "userID": "user123",
    "url": "/homepage"
}
```

2. **Query with Athena**: When you want to analyze the data, you define a schema in Athena:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE WebLogs (
    timestamp STRING,
    userID STRING,
    url STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://your-log-bucket/';
```
###### Explanation:

**`CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE WebLogs`**:  
    - This command is used to define a new external table named `WebLogs`. An external table in Athena (and other similar services) means that the table definition is in Athena, but the actual data is stored externally, in this case, in an Amazon S3 bucket.
    - **`(timestamp STRING, userID STRING, url STRING)`**:
    - These are the column definitions for the `WebLogs` table.
        - `timestamp`: A column to store the timestamp of the web log entry, defined as a string.
        - `userID`: A column to store the user ID associated with the web log entry, also defined as a string.
        - `url`: A column to store the URL that was accessed, defined as a string.
**`ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'`**:   
    - This specifies how the data in the S3 bucket should be read and interpreted.
        - `ROW FORMAT`: This keyword indicates how the rows in the data source are formatted.
        - `SERDE`: Stands for "Serializer/Deserializer". It's a way to tell Athena how to interpret the data. In this case, the data is in JSON format, so we're using the `JsonSerDe` to read it.
**`LOCATION 's3://your-log-bucket/'`**:   
    - This specifies the location in Amazon S3 where the actual data files for this table are stored. When a query is run against the `WebLogs` table in Athena, it will read the data from this S3 bucket.

3. **Adaptability**: Later, when logs include a new `userAgent` field, you can adjust your Athena schema without changing the raw data:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE WebLogs (
    timestamp STRING,
    userID STRING,
    url STRING,
    userAgent STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://your-log-bucket/';
```

**Comparison**:
- In the schema-on-write example, the structure is defined upfront, and data must fit this structure. Changes to the structure can be complex.  In essence, schema-on-write is like having a mold (schema) into which you pour liquid (data), and it takes the shape of the mold.
- In the schema-on-read example, raw data is dumped without a predefined structure. The structure is applied only when reading or querying the data, offering flexibility to adapt to evolving data needs.  Schema-on-read is like having a pile of clay (raw data) that you shape (define a schema) each time you want to use it.

**Schema-on-read** is a more flexible approach where raw data is stored without a predefined schema. The structure or schema is applied only when you read or query the data.

**Characteristics of Schema-on-Read**:

1. **Flexibility**: Data can be stored in its raw form without a predefined structure. This is especially useful for diverse datasets like logs, where the structure might not be consistent.
2. **Delayed Interpretation**: You decide how to interpret or structure the data when you read it, not when you store it.
3. **Adaptability**: As data evolves, you can change the read schema without modifying the stored data.

#### Advantages of Schema-on-Read:

1. **Flexibility**: You can store raw data in its native format without having to define its structure upfront. This is especially useful for semi-structured or unstructured data like logs or JSON files.
    
2. **Adaptability**: As your data evolves, you can easily adapt by changing the read schema without having to modify the stored data.
    
3. **Efficiency**: You can store vast amounts of raw data and decide later how you want to interpret or analyze it.

#### Table-like Translation in Athena:

When you use Athena, you're essentially applying a "table-like" view on top of your raw data stored in S3. This view is defined by the schema you set up in Athena. The actual data in S3 remains unchanged; Athena just interprets it based on the schema you've defined.

#### Relational-like Reading:

Even though the data in S3 might be in a non-relational format (like JSON or CSV), when you apply a schema in Athena, you can query it as if it were in a relational database. This is because the schema translates the raw data into a structured, table-like format that can be queried using SQL.

#### Example: Analyzing CloudTrail Logs with Athena

**Scenario**: You have CloudTrail logs stored in an S3 bucket, capturing all AWS API calls made in your account. You want to analyze a user's activity over the past year.

**Steps**:

1. **Set Up Athena**: Navigate to the Athena console in AWS.
    
2. **Define Schema**: Create a new table in Athena and define a schema that matches the structure of CloudTrail logs. AWS provides a ready-to-use schema for CloudTrail logs, so you can use that as a starting point.
    
3. **Point to S3 Data**: Specify the S3 location where your CloudTrail logs are stored.
    
4. **Run Queries**: Once the table is set up, you can start querying. For example, to find out all activities of a specific user over the past year, you might use a query like:

```sql
SELECT eventTime, eventName, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
FROM cloudtrail_logs
WHERE userIdentity.userName = 'specific_user'
AND eventTime BETWEEN '2022-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z'
ORDER BY eventTime DESC;
```

This query will give you a chronological list of all AWS API calls made by 'specific_user' over the past year.

### Supported Data Formats in Athena

1. **CSV**: Comma-separated values, a simple format where each line is a record and fields are separated by commas.
2. **TSV**: Tab-separated values, similar to CSV but fields are separated by tabs.
3. **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
4. **Parquet**: A columnar storage file format optimized for analytics. It's often used in the Hadoop ecosystem.
5. **ORC**: Optimized Row Columnar format, another columnar storage format that's highly efficient and often used with Hadoop.
6. **Avro**: A row-based storage format that supports schema evolution. It's also a popular choice in the Hadoop ecosystem.
7. **XML**: eXtensible Markup Language, a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
8. **Apache Web Server Logs**: The default log format for the Apache HTTP server.
9. **Regex**: Athena can use regular expressions to parse logs or data.

### AWS Service Logs Supported by Athena

Athena has built-in support for querying logs from various AWS services. Here are the AWS service logs that Athena can natively query:

1. **Amazon CloudFront Access Logs**
2. **AWS CloudTrail Logs**
3. **Amazon VPC Flow Logs**
4. **Amazon Route 53 Resolver Query Logs**
5. **Amazon S3 Access Logs**
6. **Amazon RDS Logs**
7. **Amazon ELB Access Logs**
8. **Amazon Redshift Audit Logs**
9. **Amazon GuardDuty Findings**
10. **AWS Lambda Logs** (when sent to CloudWatch)
11. **Amazon Inspector Findings**
12. **Amazon Macie Discovery Logs**
13. **Amazon Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL Audit Logs**
14. **Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) Logs**
15. **Amazon ECS Logs** (when tasks are configured to send logs to CloudWatch)
16. **AWS WAF Logs**
17. **AWS IoT Logs**

### Athena Does NOT Change the Data

**Key Point:** When you use Athena, your data in Amazon S3 remains unchanged. This is a fundamental principle of Athena and is vital for users to understand.

#### Why is this important?

1. **Data Integrity**: Since Athena doesn't modify the original data, there's no risk of data corruption or unintentional alterations. Your data remains in its pristine state, ensuring data integrity.
    
2. **Cost Efficiency**: With Athena, you're not duplicating data. Traditional databases often require you to import data, leading to storage costs for both the original and the imported data. With Athena, you query data directly where it resides in S3, avoiding unnecessary storage costs.
    
3. **Flexibility**: You can have multiple schemas or views on the same data. Depending on the query or the perspective you need, you can interpret the data in various ways without altering the original data.

### Athena Integration

AWS Athena can be integrated with various AWS services to further analyze, visualize, and act upon the data it queries. Here's a breakdown of some of the AWS services that can be used alongside Athena:

1. **Amazon QuickSight**:
    
    - **What it is**: QuickSight is AWS's business intelligence (BI) service that lets you create and publish interactive dashboards.
    - **Integration with Athena**: You can use Athena as a data source for QuickSight. This allows you to visualize the results of your Athena queries in a more interactive and graphical manner, making it easier to derive insights from your data.
2. **Amazon S3**:
    
    - **What it is**: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service.
    - **Integration with Athena**: Athena can save query results directly back to an S3 bucket. This is useful for keeping a record of your query results or for sharing them with other systems or team members.
3. **AWS Glue**:
    
    - **What it is**: AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service.
    - **Integration with Athena**: AWS Glue can catalog your data, making it easier to organize and search. Athena can use these Glue Data Catalogs as an external schema, allowing for seamless querying.
4. **AWS Lambda**:
    
    - **What it is**: AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
    - **Integration with Athena**: You can trigger a Lambda function based on Athena query outputs. This can be useful for automating responses or actions based on query results.
5. **Amazon CloudWatch**:
    
    - **What it is**: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service.
    - **Integration with Athena**: You can monitor Athena query performance and set up alarms using CloudWatch. This helps in keeping track of query costs, performance, and ensuring that everything is running smoothly.
6. **Amazon Redshift**:
    
    - **What it is**: Redshift is AWS's fully managed data warehouse service.
    - **Integration with Athena**: You can use Athena to query data in Amazon Redshift Spectrum. This allows you to run complex analytics against large datasets while offloading some of the querying to Athena.
7. **AWS Data Pipeline**:
    
    - **What it is**: AWS Data Pipeline is a web service for orchestrating and automating the movement and transformation of data between different AWS services and on-premises data sources.
    - **Integration with Athena**: You can use Data Pipeline to automate the execution of Athena queries and then move the results to other AWS services or on-premises data sources.

#### Amazon Athena and AWS Glue: A Powerful Duo

1. **AWS Glue Data Catalog as a Central Metadata Repository**:
    
    - AWS Glue can discover and catalog metadata from various sources, creating a centralized metadata repository known as the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
    - This catalog contains table definitions, job definitions, and other control metadata. It acts as a unified metadata repository across various services, including Athena.
2. **ETL with AWS Glue**:
    
    - You start by using AWS Glue's ETL capabilities to extract data from sources, transform it in preparation for analysis, and then load it into an S3 bucket (or another data store).
    - The transformation might involve cleaning the data, aggregating it, enriching it, or restructuring it.
3. **Integrating Athena with Glue Data Catalog**:
    
    - Once the ETL job is complete, the transformed data resides in S3, and its metadata (like table schema) is stored in the Glue Data Catalog.
    - Amazon Athena natively integrates with the AWS Glue Data Catalog. This means that when you're using Athena to run queries, it can directly reference the table definitions stored in the Glue Data Catalog.
    - You don't have to define tables in Athena manually. Instead, you can point Athena to the Glue Data Catalog, and it will automatically recognize the tables and schema defined there.
4. **Querying with Athena**:
    
    - Now, when you query the data using Athena, you're querying the transformed data stored in S3, using the schema and table definitions from the Glue Data Catalog.
    - Importantly, Athena performs read-only operations. Even though you're querying transformed data, Athena doesn't modify the underlying data in S3. It only reads the data, processes the query, and returns the result. The source data remains untouched.
5. **Benefits of This Integration**:
    
    - **Simplicity**: You don't need to manage the schema definitions in multiple places. The Glue Data Catalog serves as a single source of truth.
    - **Flexibility**: You can easily modify ETL jobs in Glue and know that Athena will be able to query the latest transformed data without any additional setup.
    - **Efficiency**: By transforming data with Glue before querying with Athena, you can optimize for query performance. For instance, transforming data into columnar formats like Parquet can make Athena queries faster and cheaper.

#### Web Server Logs:

Web servers, such as Apache or Nginx, typically produce logs in a standard format known as the Common Log Format (CLF) or the Extended Log File Format. These logs capture details about each request made to the server, including the client's IP address, request timestamp, HTTP method, URL path, response code, user agent, and more.

##### Using Athena to Query Web Server Logs:

1. **Storing Logs in S3**: Before you can query logs with Athena, you need to store them in Amazon S3. Many organizations set up automated processes to periodically move logs from their web servers to S3 buckets.
    
2. **Defining the Schema**: To query the logs with Athena, you'll need to define a table that maps to the log format. For example, for an Apache Common Log Format, the table definition might look something like this:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE apache_logs (
    ip_address STRING,
    client_identd STRING,
    user_id STRING,
    time STRING,
    request STRING,
    status_code INT,
    bytes INT,
    referer STRING,
    user_agent STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.RegexSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
    'serialization.format' = '1',
    'input.regex' = '^(\\S+) (\\S+) (\\S+) \\[([^\\]]+)\\] "(.+?)" (\\d{3}) (\\S+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)"$'
) LOCATION 's3://your-log-bucket/path/';
```

**Querying the Logs**: Once the table is defined, you can run SQL-like queries on your logs. For instance, you might want to find all 404 errors in the last 24 hours or identify the most frequently requested URLs.
```sql
SELECT request, COUNT(*) as count
FROM apache_logs
WHERE status_code = 404
GROUP BY request
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
##### Benefits of Using Athena for Web Server Logs:

1. **Ad-hoc Analysis**: Athena is perfect for ad-hoc querying. You don't need to set up complex ETL jobs or databases. Just point Athena to your logs in S3, define the schema, and start querying.
    
2. **Scalability**: Athena can handle vast amounts of data, making it suitable for analyzing logs from high-traffic websites.
    
3. **Integration with AWS Ecosystem**: You can integrate Athena with other AWS services like Amazon QuickSight for visualization, or AWS Lambda for automated actions based on query results.
    
4. **Cost-Effective**: With Athena's pay-per-query pricing, you only pay for the queries you run. This can be more cost-effective than maintaining a dedicated log analysis infrastructure.
### Athena: When to Use and When Not to Use

**Athena for Direct Querying**: Amazon Athena is particularly suitable for scenarios where you have vast amounts of raw data stored in Amazon S3, and you want to query that data directly **without the overhead of loading or transforming it first**. This is often referred to as "schema-on-read," where the schema is applied only when you read the data, not when you store it. This approach offers flexibility, especially when dealing with diverse and evolving datasets.

**When Transformation is Required**: However, there are scenarios where you might want to clean, transform, or enrich the data before analysis. This is where ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes come into play.

**AWS Glue for ETL**: If you decide that you need to transform the data before querying, AWS offers a service called **AWS Glue**. AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that makes it easy to move data between data stores and transform data.

### Athena Pricing Model

1. **Pay-per-Query**: Athena's primary pricing model is pay-per-query. You're charged based on the amount of data scanned by each query, not for the storage or the compute time.
    
2. **Data Scanned**: The cost is $5 per terabyte of data scanned. If your query scans 10GB of data, you'd pay 5 cents. This is a significant departure from traditional databases where you might pay for provisioned throughput or compute capacity.
    
3. **No Upfront Costs**: There are no upfront costs or commitments to start using Athena. You don’t need to provision resources or manage infrastructure.
    
4. **Data Storage**: Athena uses Amazon S3 for data storage, so you'll also incur standard S3 storage costs, but you won't pay for the storage within Athena itself.

#### Cost-Effectiveness:

1. **Optimize Data Format**: The cost is based on the amount of data scanned. By storing data in a columnar format like Parquet or ORC, you can reduce the amount of data scanned, as these formats allow Athena to read only the columns required by the query. This can lead to significant cost savings.
    
2. **Data Compression**: Compressing your data before storing it in S3 can further reduce the amount of data scanned, leading to lower costs.
    
3. **Partitioning**: By partitioning your data in S3 (e.g., by date, region, or another relevant metric), you can ensure that Athena only scans the relevant partitions. This can drastically reduce the amount of data scanned for many queries.
    
4. **Caching**: Athena automatically caches query results for 24 hours, so if you rerun a query without changes, you won't be charged again.
    
5. **No Idle Costs**: Unlike provisioned databases where you pay for capacity even when idle, with Athena, you only pay for the queries you run. This makes it especially cost-effective for sporadic or ad-hoc querying.

### Athena Federated Query

#### What is Athena Federated Query?

Athena Federated Query allows you to integrate Athena with various data sources such as RDS, DynamoDB, and Redshift, enabling you to execute SQL queries across these sources directly. This means you can use a single SQL query to analyze data across your Amazon RDS & Amazon Aurora databases, Amazon Redshift, and other supported data sources, in addition to your data in Amazon S3.
#### How Does It Work?

1. **Athena Data Source Connectors**: At the heart of federated queries are the Athena data source connectors. These are Lambda functions that Athena invokes for the actual task of querying the external data source. AWS provides several ready-to-use connectors for popular data sources, and you can also develop custom connectors for your specific needs.
    
2. **Lambda Invocation**: When you run a federated query, Athena invokes the appropriate Lambda function (connector) to interact with the external data source. The Lambda function then translates the SQL query into a format suitable for the target data source, fetches the data, and returns it to Athena.
    
3. **Data Processing**: Once the data is fetched from the external source, Athena processes it just like it would for data stored in S3. This means you can join, filter, and aggregate data from different sources seamlessly.
#### Use Cases:

1. **Unified Analytics**: If your organization stores data in multiple AWS services, federated queries allow you to perform analytics without moving data between services. For instance, you can join sales data in RDS with clickstream data in S3.
    
2. **Real-time Analysis**: For applications that require real-time data analysis, you can use federated queries to analyze data in your operational databases directly without ETL delays.
    
3. **Data Lake Augmentation**: If you have a data lake in S3 but also have some hot or transient data in RDS or Redshift, you can use federated queries to combine these datasets for comprehensive analysis.
    
4. **Cost Optimization**: Instead of moving large datasets between services, which can be costly and time-consuming, you can query the data in place, reducing data transfer costs.

Here are some of the data sources that can be integrated with Athena using Federated Query:

1. **Relational Databases**:
    
    - **Amazon RDS**: Supports databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.
    - **Amazon Aurora**: Both PostgreSQL and MySQL-compatible editions.
    - **Amazon Redshift**: Athena can directly query datasets in Redshift.
2. **NoSQL Databases**:
    
    - **Amazon DynamoDB**: Query your NoSQL data in DynamoDB tables.
    - **Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)**: Allows querying of your DocumentDB clusters.
3. **Data Warehouses**:
    
    - **Amazon Redshift Spectrum**: While Redshift Spectrum itself allows querying data in S3, you can use Athena to combine this with other data sources.
4. **Object Storage**:
    
    - **Amazon S3**: While Athena natively supports querying data in S3, Federated Query can be used to combine this data with other sources.
5. **Custom Data Sources**:
    
    - With the Athena Query Federation SDK, you can write custom connectors to query virtually any data source. This could include third-party databases, proprietary data stores, or even web-based data sources.
6. **Other AWS Services**:
    
    - **AWS CloudWatch Logs**: Query your operational logs directly.
    - **AWS CloudTrail**: Analyze AWS API call logs for auditing and monitoring.
7. **Third-party Integrations**:
    
    - There are connectors available (both official and community-driven) for data sources like Elasticsearch, Apache HBase, and more.

It's worth noting that while Athena Federated Query provides the capability to query these diverse data sources, the actual performance, cost, and capabilities might vary based on the specific data source and the nature of the data.
