### Tape Backups: What They Are

Tape backups are a traditional form of data storage that have been used by companies for decades. Understanding how they work, their traditional usage, and how AWS Tape Gateway simulates these physical tapes will provide a clear picture of their role in modern data management.

#### What Are Tape Backups?

Tape backups involve recording digital data on magnetic tape. Historically, they have been a popular medium for long-term data storage because of their cost-effectiveness, reliability, and capacity for storing large amounts of data.

#### How Tape Backups Work

1. **Data Writing**: Backup software writes data to a tape drive. The data is stored sequentially on the magnetic tape.
2. **Storage and Retrieval**: Once data is written, the tape is typically removed and stored securely. To access the data, the tape is loaded back into a tape drive, and the system reads the tape sequentially to locate and retrieve the desired data.
3. **Rotation and Archiving**: Many businesses use a tape rotation system, keeping several copies of backups at different ages (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly backups) and archiving tapes for long-term storage.

#### Traditional Use of Tape Backups

- **Disaster Recovery**: Tapes have been widely used for off-site backup storage as a part of disaster recovery plans.
- **Archiving**: Tapes are suitable for archiving because they can store data for 30 years or more if properly cared for.
- **Cost-Effective Scaling**: For large amounts of data, tapes have traditionally been more cost-effective than hard drives or solid-state drives.

#### AWS Tape Gateway and Tape Simulation

AWS Tape Gateway simulates a physical tape infrastructure in the cloud. Hereâ€™s how it replicates traditional tape backups:

- **Virtual Tape Library (VTL)**: Tape Gateway provides a VTL, complete with virtual tape drives and virtual tapes, which are exposed to the backup software via iSCSI.
- **Data Writing and Storage**: Backup software writes data to these virtual tapes just like it would to physical tapes. This data is then stored in Amazon S3.
- **Archiving in Glacier**: Virtual tapes can be archived in Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive, replicating the off-site archival aspect of physical tapes.

#### Common Tape Types and Differences

Several types of magnetic tapes have been used over the years, each with different capacities, sizes, and compatibilities:

1. **Linear Tape-Open (LTO)**: A widely-used format in modern tape backups. LTO tapes have evolved through several generations, with increasing capacity and speed (LTO-1 to LTO-8, and beyond).
2. **Digital Linear Tape (DLT)**: Popular for mid-range storage solutions, DLT has been used extensively in the past but has largely been superseded by LTO.
3. **Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT)**: A high-capacity tape format developed by Sony, notable for its compact size and MIC (Memory in Cassette) feature for faster file access.

#### LTO-9

The LTO-9 standard, the ninth generation in the LTO series, offers significant improvements over its predecessors in terms of capacity and performance. Let's delve into the characteristics of LTO-9, the nature of tape drives, and how data is stored sequentially on tape drives.

##### Characteristics of LTO-9

1. **Storage Capacity**:
    
    - **Uncompressed Data**: LTO-9 tapes can hold up to 24TB (terabytes) of uncompressed raw data.
    - **Compressed Data**: With typical compression ratios (usually around 2.5:1), LTO-9 can store up to 60TB of compressed data.
2. **Data Transfer Rate**: The speed at which data can be written to or read from an LTO-9 tape is significantly higher than previous generations, enhancing the efficiency of backup and restoration processes.
    
3. **Backward Compatibility**: LTO-9 drives can typically read tapes from a couple of generations back (e.g., LTO-7) and write to the immediate previous generation (e.g., LTO-8), facilitating gradual upgrades in storage infrastructure.
    
4. **Encryption and WORM (Write Once, Read Many)**: LTO-9 supports encryption for data security and WORM capabilities, which is crucial for compliance and archival purposes where data should not be altered after being written.

##### Tape Drives and Their Operation

- **Single Tape Usage**: A tape drive can use one tape at a time to either read data from it or write data to it. This means that the operation of tape drives is inherently sequential.
    
- **Read/Write Mechanism**: Tape drives work by passing the tape linearly over a read/write head, writing data to the tape or reading data from it as it moves past the head.

##### Sequential Access on Tape Drives

- **Nature of Access**: Data on tape drives is stored sequentially, meaning it is written and read in a linear order. This is different from the random access provided by traditional hard drives, where the read/write head can move to any part of the disk to access data.
    
- **Example of Sequential Access**: Imagine a scenario where a company uses an LTO-9 tape for daily backups. The backup process starts at the beginning of the tape, writing data sequentially until the end. If they need to restore data from two weeks ago, the tape drive must wind through all the data from the preceding days until it reaches the desired point. This is akin to fast-forwarding through a film reel to reach a specific scene.
    
- **Contrast with Random Access**: In contrast, on a traditional hard disk drive (HDD), the read/write head can quickly move to any position on the disk to access data directly. For example, if you're retrieving a file stored on an HDD, the drive can immediately seek to the file's location on the disk, regardless of the order in which the data was written.

Each tape type has its own set of attributes regarding storage capacity, data transfer speed, durability, and compatibility with tape drives. The choice of tape type traditionally depended on the specific backup and archival needs of a business, balancing capacity, performance, and cost.

In the modern context, services like AWS Tape Gateway eliminate the need for physical tapes while preserving the familiar tape-based backup workflows, providing scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness of cloud storage. This approach offers the benefits of tape systems (like sequential access and portability) with the added advantages of cloud storage, such as ease of access, lower physical storage requirements, and improved disaster recovery capabilities.

### Offsite Tape Solutions

Offsite tape storage is a critical component of many enterprise data management strategies, particularly for backup and disaster recovery. It involves storing physical tape backups at a location separate from the main data center or office premises. Let's explore how offsite tape storage is commonly used in enterprise environments and its typical characteristics.

#### Common Use in Enterprise Environments

1. **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**: The primary use of offsite tape storage is for disaster recovery. By storing backup tapes at a different location, companies ensure that they can recover their data even if the primary site is compromised by natural disasters, fire, theft, or other catastrophic events.
    
2. **Data Archiving**: Enterprises with long-term data retention requirements, often for regulatory compliance, use offsite tape storage for archiving. This provides a secure and cost-effective way to maintain historical data.
    
3. **Data Protection and Security**: Offsite storage adds an extra layer of security. Tapes stored away from the primary business location are less susceptible to local system failures, cyberattacks, or physical breaches.
    
4. **Rotational Schemes**: Many businesses implement a tape rotation scheme (e.g., Grandfather-Father-Son), where different sets of tapes are rotated through various stages, including offsite storage, to ensure that a range of backup dates is always available.

#### Characteristics of Offsite Tape Storage

1. **Security Measures**: Offsite storage facilities typically have robust security measures, including physical security guards, surveillance cameras, controlled access, and fire protection systems.
    
2. **Climate Control**: Tapes are sensitive to environmental conditions; therefore, offsite facilities usually have climate-controlled environments to prevent data loss or degradation due to temperature and humidity fluctuations.
    
3. **Data Retrieval Processes**: Retrieving tapes from offsite storage can be time-consuming. Enterprises need to have a well-defined process for data retrieval, which often involves requesting the specific tapes and having them physically transported back to the primary site or a recovery site.
    
4. **Inventory Management**: Keeping an accurate and up-to-date inventory of the tapes stored offsite is crucial. This ensures that the right tapes can be quickly located and retrieved when needed.
    
5. **Vendor Management**: Many businesses use third-party vendors for offsite tape storage. Effective vendor management, including regular audits and adherence to SLAs (Service Level Agreements), is essential.
    
6. **Transportation and Handling**: The process of transporting tapes to and from the offsite facility must be secure and reliable. Tapes are often transported in secure, unmarked vehicles and containers to minimize the risk of loss, theft, or damage.
    
7. **Compliance and Regulation**: Offsite storage facilities must often comply with various regulations, such as HIPAA for healthcare data or Sarbanes-Oxley for financial data, ensuring that the storage practices meet legal requirements.

    - The VTL interface provided by Tape Gateway is compatible with common backup applications that are traditionally designed for physical tape formats like LTO (Linear Tape-Open).
2. **Backup Application Configuration**:
    
    - The backup application on the on-premises server is configured to recognize the AWS Tape Gateway's VTL as its tape library.
    - This configuration involves specifying the IP address of the Tape Gateway and ensuring that the backup software can communicate with it via the iSCSI protocol.
3. **Tape Drive Emulation**:
    
    - Within the VTL, AWS Tape Gateway emulates tape drives. These virtual tape drives appear to the backup software just like physical tape drives would.
    - This emulation is critical because it allows the backup software to interact with the Tape Gateway as if it were a physical tape library.

##### Process of Data Transfer to VTL

1. **Execution of Backup Jobs**:
    
    - When a backup job is initiated, the backup software writes data to the virtual tapes in the Tape Gateway's VTL. This process is identical to how data would be written to a physical tape in a traditional tape drive.
2. **Data Storage and Management**:
    
    - The data written to the virtual tapes is stored in Amazon S3. From the perspective of the backup software, it's as if the data is being written to a physical tape, but in reality, itâ€™s securely stored in the cloud.
    - Users can create, manage, and delete virtual tapes through the AWS Management Console, allowing for flexible tape management without the physical constraints.
3. **Archiving and Retrieval**:
    
    - For long-term retention, virtual tapes can be archived in Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.

The Virtual Tape Shelf (VTS) is a key component of AWS's Tape Gateway service, complementing the Virtual Tape Library (VTL) functionality. Understanding the distinction between VTS and VTL is important for effectively leveraging AWS's cloud-based backup and archival solutions.

#### What is Virtual Tape Shelf (VTS)?

1. **Definition**: The Virtual Tape Shelf (VTS) is an extension of AWS Tape Gateway that allows for the archival storage of virtual tapes. Once a virtual tape in the VTL is no longer needed for immediate backup or restore operations, it can be moved to the VTS.
    
2. **Storage Location**: Tapes in the VTS are stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive. These services provide secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage options for long-term data archiving and backup.
    
3. **Data Accessibility**: While the VTS is cost-effective for long-term storage, accessing data from tapes in VTS is slower compared to the VTL. This is because Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive are designed for infrequently accessed data, with retrieval times ranging from a few hours to a day.
    
4. **Use Case**: VTS is ideal for data that must be retained for extended periods due to regulatory requirements, compliance needs, or for historical reference but is not expected to be accessed frequently.

#### How VTS Differs from VTL

1. **Primary Function**:
    
    - **VTL**: Acts as a cloud-based emulation of a physical tape library, designed for frequent data access and active use in backup and restore operations.
    - **VTS**: Serves as a long-term storage solution for data that does not require regular access.
2. **Storage Costs and Performance**:
    
    - **VTL**: Virtual tapes in the VTL are stored in Amazon S3, which has higher storage costs but provides faster access to data.
    - **VTS**: Offers significantly lower storage costs with Amazon S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive, but at the expense of slower data retrieval times.
3. **Data Retrieval**:
    
    - **VTL**: Data retrieval from virtual tapes in the VTL is relatively quick, similar to accessing data from a traditional tape library.
    - **VTS**: Retrieving data from the VTS involves a delay due to the nature of Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive services, designed for infrequent access.
4. **Operational Use**:
    
    - **VTL**: Generally used for ongoing backup operations and short-term data retention needs.
    - **VTS**: Ideal for long-term archival, fulfilling compliance, and regulatory data retention policies.

### Virtual Tapes

AWS Virtual Tapes play a central role in cloud-based data backup and archival strategies. They function as simulated tape cartridges, providing a bridge between traditional tape-based backup systems and AWS's cloud storage solutions. Let's explore how these virtual tapes work, their size limitations, and how the Tape Gateway can handle large amounts of data.

#### How AWS Virtual Tapes Work

1. **Virtual Tape Creation**: In the AWS Storage Gateway console, you can create virtual tapes, specifying their size as needed. These virtual tapes are then accessible in your Virtual Tape Library (VTL).
    
2. **Data Backup and Storage**:
    
    - When your backup application writes data to a virtual tape, itâ€™s actually writing to an Amazon S3 object that represents the virtual tape.
    - The data is stored in Amazon S3, combining the reliability and scalability of AWS cloud storage with the familiarity of tape-based backup processes.
3. **Archival and Retrieval**:
    
    - Once a virtual tape is no longer actively used for backup, it can be moved to the Virtual Tape Shelf (VTS) for long-term storage in Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.
    - Retrieving data from a tape in the VTS involves a delay, as the data is stored in slower-to-access, cost-effective storage services.

#### Virtual Tape Size Limitations

1. **Minimum Size**: The minimum size for an AWS virtual tape is 100 GB. This allows for flexibility and cost-effectiveness in managing smaller data sets.
    
2. **Maximum Size and Relation to S3 Object Size**:
    
    - The maximum size of an AWS virtual tape is 5 TB, which is also the maximum size of an individual Amazon S3 object.
    - This size limit ensures that each virtual tape can be efficiently managed and stored as a single object in Amazon S3.

#### Handling Large Amounts of Data

- **1PB Across 1500 Tapes**: The AWS Storage Gateway can manage up to 1PB of data across 1500 virtual tapes.
- **Scalability**: This high degree of scalability is achieved by leveraging the cloud's storage capabilities. You can create as many tapes as needed within the limit of 1500 tapes, each up to 5 TB, to reach a total of 1PB of storage.
- **Multiple Gateways for Expansion**: If more storage is required beyond the 1PB/1500 tape limit, additional Storage Gateways can be deployed to scale the storage capacity further.

#### Use Cases

- **Backup and Recovery**: Virtual tapes are primarily used for backup and recovery purposes, offering a familiar workflow for enterprises used to tape backups.
- **Compliance and Archival**: For regulatory compliance and long-term data retention, virtual tapes provide a cost-effective and reliable solution.

#### Limits of the Virtual Tape Shelf (VTS)

1. **Storage Capacity**: One of the key features of VTS is its virtually limitless storage capacity. Unlike physical tape libraries or the VTL, which are constrained by physical space, the number of tapes they can hold, and a hard storage amount limit, VTS leverages the vast storage capacity of Amazon S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive.
    
2. **Number of Tapes**: While individual AWS accounts have a limit on the number of active virtual tapes in the VTL, there is no practical limit to the number of tapes that can be archived in the VTS. This allows for extensive scalability in data archiving.
    
3. **Data Retrieval Time**: The trade-off for using VTS's cost-effective storage is longer data retrieval times. Retrieving data from tapes stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive can take several hours, which is a crucial consideration for backup and recovery planning.

#### Exporting Tapes from VTL to VTS

1. **Backup and Archival Process**:
    
    - Initially, data backups are written to virtual tapes in the VTL. These tapes reside in Amazon S3, allowing for frequent and fast access when needed.
    - When a virtual tape is no longer required for regular access, it can be archived for long-term storage.
2. **Exporting Tapes**:
    
    - To export a tape from the VTL to the VTS, you use the AWS Management Console or AWS SDKs.
    - In the console, you can change the status of the virtual tape from the VTL to the "archived" status, which moves it to the VTS.
    - Once archived, the tape is stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive, depending on your configuration and needs.
3. **Access to Archived Tapes**:
    
    - Archived tapes are not immediately accessible for read/write operations. To access the data, you must first initiate a retrieval request.
    - The retrieval process can take several hours, so itâ€™s primarily used for data that does not require frequent or immediate access.
4. **Cost and Compliance**:
    
    - Archiving tapes to the VTS is cost-effective, particularly for compliance with long-term data retention policies.
    - It provides a secure and durable solution for data archiving, ensuring data integrity and availability for years.
