AWS Gateway Storage Cached Volumes and Stored Volumes are two configurations offered by Amazon Web Services as part of their Storage Gateway service. They provide different ways of integrating on-premises environments with cloud storage. Let's go over each aspect:

### Gateway Storage Cached Volumes

1. **What They Are**: A configuration in AWS Storage Gateway where primary data is stored in Amazon S3, and only frequently accessed data is cached on-premises.
    
2. **How They Work**: Data written to these volumes is stored in AWS S3, with a cache of the most recently accessed data maintained on-premises for low-latency access.
    
3. **Use Cases**:
    
    - Ideal for read-heavy environments needing large cloud storage capacity while maintaining fast local access to frequently used data.
    - Useful for scenarios like disaster recovery due to primary data storage in the cloud.
4. **Key Features**:
    
    - **Size Limitation**: Supports volumes up to 1,024 TB in size, making it suitable for very large datasets.
    - **POSIX Compliance**: Supports POSIX-compliant data, meaning it adheres to a standard for maintaining compatibility between operating systems, useful for file systems and applications that rely on POSIX standards for file and directory operations.
5. **Differences from Stored Volumes**:
    
    - Data is primarily in S3, with only a local cache, as opposed to all data being stored on-premises in Stored Volumes.
    - More suited for read-heavy workloads and environments where cloud storage scalability is essential.

### Gateway Storage Stored Volumes

1. **What They Are**: A configuration where your on-premises storage is the primary data storage, backed up to AWS S3.
    
2. **How They Work**: Data is stored on your local storage hardware and asynchronously backed up to S3 in the form of EBS snapshots.
    
3. **Use Cases**:
    
    - Ideal for environments requiring low-latency access to their entire dataset.
    - Suitable for scenarios where local data storage and performance are prioritized, with reliable off-site backups.
4. **Key Features**:
    
    - **Size Limitation**: Supports volumes up to 512 TB, focusing on on-premises storage capacity.
    - **POSIX Compliance**: Also supports POSIX-compliant data, ensuring compatibility and consistent file system behavior across different operating systems.
5. **Differences from Cached Volumes**:
    
    - All primary data is kept on-premises with backups in S3, unlike Cached Volumes which store primary data in S3.
    - Better for environments where high-performance local storage is crucial, and where the size of the dataset is within the 512 TB limit.
