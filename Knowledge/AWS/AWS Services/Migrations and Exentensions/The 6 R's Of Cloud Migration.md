The 6 R's of cloud migration represent different strategies for moving applications to the cloud. These strategies range from simple lift-and-shift approaches to more complex re-architecting of applications. Understanding each strategy is crucial in determining the best approach for a specific cloud migration scenario.
### The 6 R's
#### 1. Rehosting (Lift-and-Shift)

- **What It Is:** Moving applications to the cloud without making changes. This is often the fastest migration strategy.
- **How It Works:** Applications are taken as-is from an existing environment and migrated to the cloud.
- **When to Use:** Ideal for large-scale migrations where speed is a priority. Useful when the primary goal is to quickly get out of a data center.
- **Scenario:** A company facing data center lease expiration and needing to move applications quickly without significant investment in modifications.

#### 2. Replatforming

- **What It Is:** Making minor optimizations to applications to take advantage of cloud capabilities without changing the core architecture.
- **How It Works:** Adjusting certain components of an application to benefit from the cloud, like moving to a managed database service.
- **When to Use:** When there are clear benefits from the cloud features but a full-scale re-architecture is not feasible or necessary.
- **Scenario:** Migrating a web application to the cloud and switching to managed cloud services for database and caching without altering the application's core architecture.

#### 3. Repurchasing

- **What It Is:** Moving from a traditional license to a cloud-based service, often a SaaS (Software as a Service) product.
- **How It Works:** Switching to a different product that's cloud-native, often changing the application provider in the process.
- **When to Use:** When the existing application is outdated or a cloud-native solution offers significant advantages.
- **Scenario:** Replacing an on-premises CRM with a cloud-based CRM system like Salesforce.

#### 4. Refactoring/Re-architecting

- **What It Is:** Modifying or completely redesigning the application to be cloud-native.
- **How It Works:** Involves rethinking how the application is architected and developed, typically to add features, scale, or performance that would be difficult to achieve in the existing environment.
- **When to Use:** When the business needs require adding features, scalability, or performance that the existing application architecture cannot provide.
- **Scenario:** Rewriting a monolithic application as microservices to improve scalability and resilience.

#### 5. Retire

- **What It Is:** Identifying IT assets that are no longer useful and can be turned off.
- **How It Works:** Through the discovery process, you might find applications or components that are no longer needed.
- **When to Use:** To reduce costs and complexity by eliminating unnecessary tools or applications.
- **Scenario:** Decommissioning legacy applications that have been replaced or are no longer in use.

#### 6. Retain

- **What It Is:** Keeping some applications or components in the existing environment.
- **How It Works:** Certain elements of the IT portfolio are not ready or suitable for cloud migration and are kept in the current environment, at least temporarily.
- **When to Use:** When applications require major rework to move to the cloud or when they are tightly coupled with physical hardware.
- **Scenario:** Retaining a legacy system that requires direct access to specific hardware or is too costly to re-architect for the cloud.

### Rehosting (Lift-and-Shift) in Depth

Rehosting, commonly known as "lift-and-shift," is a strategy where existing applications are migrated to the cloud without modification. It's often the first step in a larger cloud migration journey.

#### What It Entails

1. **Direct Migration:** Applications and their associated data are moved to the cloud as-is, without making changes to the application’s architecture, features, or functions.
    
2. **Infrastructure Emulation:** The cloud environment is set up to emulate the on-premises infrastructure, ensuring compatibility and minimal disruption.

#### AWS Services for Lift-and-Shift

Several AWS services facilitate the lift-and-shift approach:

1. **AWS Migration Hub:**
    
    - Provides a central location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions.
2. **AWS Server Migration Service (SMS):**
    
    - Automates the migration of on-premises servers to AWS. It replicates server VMs to the cloud and creates ready-to-use AMIs.
3. **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):**
    
    - Helps migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime.
4. **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):**
    
    - After migration, applications often run on EC2 instances, which provide scalable compute capacity in the cloud.

#### How These Services Work

- **AWS SMS:** Incrementally replicates live server volumes to the cloud, creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for seamless migration.
- **AWS DMS:** Connects to source and target databases, replicates the data, and allows you to keep the source database operational during migration.
- **EC2 Instances:** Host the migrated applications; you can select instance types and sizes that match your on-premises environment.

#### Limitations

- **Not Optimizing for Cloud:** Lift-and-shift doesn’t take full advantage of cloud-native features, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and higher costs.
- **Scalability Issues:** Applications not designed for the cloud might not scale efficiently in a cloud environment.
- **Legacy System Compatibility:** Some legacy applications may not be well-suited for a cloud environment without re-architecture.

#### When to Use Lift-and-Shift

- **Quick Migration Needs:** When moving out of a data center quickly (e.g., end of lease, cost reduction mandates).
- **Initial Phase of a Larger Strategy:** As a first step in a more comprehensive cloud strategy, with plans to optimize or re-architect later.
- **Legacy Systems:** For legacy applications where re-architecting is not feasible or cost-effective in the short term.

#### When Not to Use

- **Cloud-Native Optimization Desired:** If you're looking to fully leverage cloud-native features like elasticity, serverless computing, or microservices.
- **Cost-Sensitive Applications:** If the application will be more expensive to run in the cloud without optimization.
- **Highly Scalable Systems:** For systems that require auto-scaling and high availability that the cloud offers, re-architecting might be a better approach.

### Replatforming in Cloud Migration

Replatforming, sometimes referred to as "lift, tinker, and shift," involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit without changing the core architecture of the application. It's a middle ground between rehosting and refactoring.

#### What It Entails

1. **Moderate Alterations:**
    - The application is altered to some extent, but not completely redesigned. Changes are made to take advantage of cloud efficiencies.
2. **Optimization Without Overhaul:**
    - Adjustments are made to the application’s architecture, such as changing the database to a managed service, but without a full-scale redesign.

#### AWS Services for Replatforming

Several AWS services facilitate the replatforming approach:

1. **Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora:**
    
    - Managed relational database services that can replace traditional databases, providing scalability, high availability, and managed backups.
2. **Amazon Elastic Beanstalk:**
    
    - An easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services, handling much of the management and provisioning.
3. **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or AWS Kubernetes Service (EKS):**
    
    - For applications being moved into containerized environments.

#### How These Services Work

- **Amazon RDS/Aurora:** Automates tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair for databases.
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** Simplifies deployment by handling load balancing, scaling, and monitoring.
- **ECS/EKS:** Efficient for applications being migrated into a containerized environment, providing a managed container orchestration service.

#### Limitations

- **Complexity and Risk:** Slightly more complex and risky compared to pure rehosting, as it involves changes to the application.
- **Resource Requirement:** May require additional resources and skills to manage the optimizations.
- **Dependency Management:** Dependencies on specific cloud services may increase, potentially leading to vendor lock-in.

#### When to Use Replatforming

- **Performance Improvement Needs:** When there are clear performance gains from cloud features but a full-scale re-architecture is not justified.
- **Cost Optimization:** When moving to managed services can reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO).
- **Capability Enhancement:** To add capabilities like auto-scaling, improved disaster recovery, or better monitoring without a full re-architecture.

#### When Not to Use

- **Tightly Coupled Architecture:** For applications with a monolithic architecture that are not easily adaptable to cloud services.
- **Limited Cloud Skills:** If the team lacks the necessary skills to manage cloud-native services effectively.

### Repurchasing in Cloud Migration

Repurchasing, often referred to as "drop and shop," involves moving from a traditional licensing model, typically for on-premises software, to a cloud-based subscription model. This strategy often entails switching to a different product or vendor that offers a cloud-native solution.

#### What It Entails

1. **Switching Products:**
    
    - Moving from an existing on-premises or self-managed solution to a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. This can involve adopting entirely new software that serves a similar function.
2. **Embracing SaaS:**
    
    - Embracing the SaaS model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, software updates, and security.

#### AWS Services and SaaS Solutions

While AWS doesn't directly provide SaaS solutions for repurchasing, it hosts numerous third-party SaaS products that can be part of a repurchasing strategy.

1. **AWS Marketplace:**
    
    - A digital catalog that contains thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that can be used in a repurchasing strategy.
2. **SaaS Partners:**
    
    - Numerous vendors offer SaaS versions of applications for various business needs, like CRM, ERP, HRM, and more.

#### How It Works

- **Subscription-Based Models:** Instead of maintaining and upgrading software, companies subscribe to a service that is continually updated and managed by the SaaS provider.
    
- **Integration:** In some cases, SaaS products offer integration capabilities with existing systems and data, which may be critical for business operations.

#### Limitations

- **Loss of Control:** Relying on a SaaS provider means less control over the software's functionality, performance, and security.
- **Vendor Lock-In:** There's a potential risk of becoming dependent on a specific vendor's ecosystem and pricing model.
- **Customization Limits:** SaaS solutions might not offer the same level of customization or flexibility as an in-house managed application.

#### When to Use Repurchasing

- **Outdated Software:** When current on-premises solutions are outdated and upgrading them is not cost-effective.
- **Need for Advanced Features:** If the SaaS alternative offers advanced features and capabilities that are not available in the current solution.
- **Reducing Maintenance Overhead:** To eliminate the need for maintaining, updating, and securing certain software applications.

#### When Not to Use

- **Highly Customized Applications:** If existing applications are heavily customized and integral to business operations, finding a suitable SaaS equivalent might be challenging.
- **Data Sensitivity:** For organizations with highly sensitive data, where storing data off-premises may not meet compliance requirements.

### Refactoring/Re-architecting

Refactoring or re-architecting in the context of cloud migration is a comprehensive approach that involves a fundamental rethinking and redesigning of applications to fully leverage the benefits of cloud computing. This strategy is the most involved among the 6 R's and requires significant time and resources but can lead to substantial improvements in performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

#### What is Refactoring/Re-architecting?

Refactoring in cloud migration refers to altering the existing code base of an application to make it more suited for a cloud environment. This often means moving away from traditional, monolithic architectures to a more modular, microservices-oriented architecture.

2. **Regulatory and Compliance Restrictions:** In cases where legal or compliance requirements prevent the storage or processing of data in the cloud.
3. **Cost-Prohibitive Migration:** When the cost and effort of migrating an application outweigh the benefits of having it in the cloud.

#### When Not to Use

1. **Stalling Modernization:** If retaining is used as a means to avoid necessary modernization or digital transformation.
2. **Feasible Cloud Migration:** For applications that can be migrated without significant risk or cost, especially if they would benefit significantly from cloud capabilities.

### AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)

AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is an agentless service that simplifies and automates the migration of on-premises servers to AWS. It's designed to streamline the process of moving virtual machines (VMs) from on-premises environments, including VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, and physical servers, to the AWS cloud.

#### How AWS SMS Works

1. **Initial Setup:**
    
    - Connect your on-premises environment to AWS SMS. This involves configuring the appropriate permissions and roles in your AWS account and setting up a secure connection between your on-premises environment and AWS.
2. **Server Replication:**
    
    - AWS SMS automatically replicates live server VMs to the cloud, creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) without causing downtime or impacting performance.
3. **Incremental Synchronization:**
    
    - After the initial replication, AWS SMS synchronizes any changes made to the on-premises VMs with their cloud counterparts. This incremental approach minimizes network usage and ensures that the cloud-based VMs remain up-to-date.
4. **Transition to EC2 Instances:**
    
    - Once replication is complete, the AMIs can be launched as Amazon EC2 instances, effectively migrating your servers to the cloud.
5. **Schedule and Track Migrations:**
    
    - AWS SMS allows you to schedule replication windows and track the status of migrations, providing visibility into the process.

#### Scenario: Migrating an On-Premises Server to AWS Using SMS

##### Preparation Phase

1. **Assess and Plan:**
    
    - Conduct an assessment of the on-premises server to ensure compatibility with AWS SMS. Identify the server's roles, applications, and data dependencies.
2. **Set Up AWS Environment:**
    
    - Create an AWS account if you don’t have one.
    - Set up an Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to host the migrated servers.
    - Configure IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and permissions for AWS SMS.

##### Configuration Phase

1. **Install the AWS SMS Connector:**
    - For environments like VMware, deploy the AWS SMS Connector as a VM. This connector will facilitate the communication between your on-premises environment and AWS.

    - Regularly monitor the replication process using AWS SMS console. Manage and adjust replication settings as needed to ensure efficient and secure data transfer.
3. **Test the Cloud-Based Server:**
    
    - Once the initial replication is complete, launch an EC2 instance from the AMI for testing. Validate the performance, connectivity, and functionality of the applications running on the server.
4. **Incremental Updates:**
    
    - AWS SMS will continue to replicate any changes from the on-premises server to the cloud until you're ready for the final cutover.

##### Cutover Phase

1. **Finalize Migration:**
    
    - Once satisfied with the testing, schedule a final cutover where the on-premises server will be decommissioned, and the cloud-based EC2 instance will become the primary server.
2. **Update DNS and Network Settings:**
    
    - Update DNS records and network settings to redirect traffic to the AWS-based server.
3. **Decommission On-Premises Server:**
    
    - Safely decommission the on-premises server, ensuring all data and services are fully operational in AWS.

### AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that simplifies database migration to, from, and within AWS clouds. It supports the migration of databases from on-premises to AWS, between on-premises and cloud instances, or between cloud instances.

#### How AWS DMS Works

1. **Initial Setup:**
    
    - Create a replication instance in AWS DMS. This instance will facilitate the migration process.
    - Set up source and target endpoints in DMS. The source endpoint is your existing database, and the target endpoint is where you want the database to migrate to, which could be on AWS RDS, Amazon Aurora, or another supported AWS database service.
2. **Migration Task Configuration:**
    
    - Define a migration task in DMS, which includes specifying the databases or schemas to migrate, the migration type (full load, change data capture (CDC), or both), and any additional settings or transformations.
3. **Data Replication:**
    
    - AWS DMS then begins the process of migrating the data. For a full load migration, all the existing data is transferred to the target. If CDC is enabled, ongoing changes are also captured and replicated.
4. **Monitoring and Management:**
    
    - Throughout the migration process, you can monitor the progress and performance of the migration task using the AWS DMS console.

#### Scenario: Migrating an On-Premises Database to AWS Using DMS

##### Preparation Phase

1. **Assess and Plan:**
    
    - Evaluate the on-premises database for AWS compatibility and determine the best target database service on AWS (e.g., RDS, Aurora).
2. **Set Up AWS Environment:**
    
    - Ensure the necessary VPC, security groups, and IAM roles are in place in AWS.

##### Configuration Phase

1. **Configure Source and Target Endpoints:**
    
    - Set up the source endpoint to point to the on-premises database and the target endpoint to the AWS database service.
2. **Create Replication Instance:**
    
    - Launch a DMS replication instance that will perform the data migration.

##### Migration Phase

1. **Define Migration Task:**
    
    - Create and configure the migration task in DMS, specifying the data to be migrated, the migration type, and any transformations or mappings.
2. **Start Migration Process:**
    
    - Initiate the migration process. Monitor the process using the DMS dashboard for progress and any issues.
3. **Testing:**
    
    - Once the initial migration is complete, perform tests to ensure data integrity and application functionality.
4. **Activate Change Data Capture (CDC):**
    
    - If the application is still in use, enable CDC to replicate ongoing changes to the target database.

##### Cutover Phase

1. **Finalize Migration:**
    
    - After ensuring that the target database is up-to-date and functioning correctly, switch the application connections to the new AWS-based database.
2. **Decommission On-Premises Database:**
    
    - Safely decommission the on-premises database system.

#### How DMS Differs from Server Migration Service (SMS)

- **Purpose and Focus:**
    
    - AWS DMS is specifically focused on database migration, whereas AWS SMS is designed for migrating entire servers, including their operating systems and applications.
- **Methodology:**
    
    - DMS deals with the complexities of migrating database schemas, data, and stored procedures. It ensures data integrity and offers transformations and validations. SMS, on the other hand, replicates the entire server, including non-database files and configurations.
- **Use Case:**
    
    - DMS is ideal when you only need to migrate a database to the cloud, while SMS is used when you need to migrate the whole server, possibly including the database as part of the server.

### The Cloud Migration Process

Now, let's delve deeper into each of the 6 R's of cloud migration, exploring the complexities and nuances of this strategic framework.

#### Discover

**Process:**

- Deploy discovery tools across your IT environment to automatically capture a wide array of information, including server types, configurations, usage statistics, and existing workloads.
- Conduct interviews with stakeholders and IT staff to gather qualitative data about system performance, pain points, and operational requirements.

**Example Scenario:** A healthcare provider with an extensive portfolio of patient management systems, electronic medical records, and billing systems uses discovery tools to map out all digital assets. This step includes understanding data flow, identifying critical patient data, and pinpointing legacy systems that require special consideration due to regulatory compliance.

#### Assess

**Process:**

- Evaluate each discovered asset against several criteria, including technical fit, business value, legal and regulatory compliance, security requirements, and complexity of migration.
- Perform a dependency analysis to understand how applications interact and the potential impact of migrating in phases.
- Develop a business case for each application, including a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis comparing on-premises costs to projected cloud costs.

**Example Scenario:** The healthcare provider analyzes their on-premises electronic medical records system and recognizes that while the system is integral to operations, it is also expensive to maintain, not agile enough for new healthcare regulations, and a candidate for cloud-based alternatives that offer enhanced security and compliance features.

#### Prioritize

**Process:**

- Score and rank applications based on the assessment phase, considering factors like business impact, migration difficulty, and the potential for cost savings or performance improvements.
- Create a detailed migration plan that sequences the migration to minimize business disruption, considering quick wins that can build momentum and support for the migration effort.

**Example Scenario:** The provider identifies a non-critical internal reporting tool as a quick win for migration, which would provide immediate benefits in terms of reduced infrastructure costs and improved report generation times.

#### Choose Strategic Path & Migration Method

**Process:**

- For each application, consider the appropriate migration strategy among the 6 R's based on the assessments made. Factors like the need for agility, cost savings, improved performance, and the strategic importance of modernizing certain applications will influence this decision.
- Develop a tailored migration strategy for each application, which may include a combination of the 6 R's rather than a single approach.

**Example Scenario:** The patient management system is slated for replatforming to leverage a managed database service, while the billing system is identified for refactoring to take advantage of serverless architectures that could scale based on demand.

#### Retire

**Process:**

- Once you've identified which systems are to be retired, plan for data migration, user training, and system decommissioning.
- Ensure all regulatory requirements are met in terms of data retention and that all necessary data is archived appropriately.

**Example Scenario:** An outdated patient scheduling system is retired. All historical scheduling data is migrated to a new cloud-based scheduling system, and the old system is decommissioned following data retention laws.

#### Rehosting

**Process:**

- Choose a replication tool suitable for your environment (like AWS SMS) and configure it to connect to your on-premises servers.
- Conduct a pilot migration to validate the process, iron out any wrinkles in the migration procedure, and ensure that the rehosted application performs as expected in the cloud.

**Example Scenario:** A set of on-premises web servers hosting patient portals are rehosted to AWS. The healthcare provider carefully plans for HIPAA compliance during the migration, ensuring that all patient data remains secure.

#### Replatforming

**Process:**

- Determine the cloud services that can replace or enhance the current platform components. This might involve, for example, moving to an AWS managed service like RDS for database needs.
- Modify application configurations and codebases to leverage the new platform services without overhauling the application’s basic architecture.

**Example Scenario:** The provider’s custom-built healthcare application is replatformed from using self-managed databases to Amazon RDS, which offers automated backups, patching, and scaling, reducing operational overhead.

#### Repurchasing

**Process:**

- Evaluate available SaaS offerings to replace existing applications. Consider integration capabilities, feature sets, and vendor support.
- Plan the data migration to the new SaaS platform, including any necessary data transformation or cleanup.

**Example Scenario:** The healthcare provider switches from an on-premises customer relationship management (CRM) system to a cloud-based CRM solution tailored for healthcare, enhancing their patient engagement and outreach capabilities.

#### Validation

**Process:**

- Design comprehensive test plans to validate each migrated or replaced system. Testing should encompass performance, security, functionality, and integration testing with other systems.
- Engage end-users in testing to ensure the migrated systems meet operational needs and that any changes in workflow are understood and accepted.

**Example Scenario:** After migrating the electronic medical records system, the provider runs several test cases to simulate daily operations, ensuring that all records are accessible and that new cloud-based workflows are efficient.

#### Transition

**Process:**

- Schedule the final cutover to the new systems, ensuring all stakeholders are informed and any required downtime is communicated.
- Execute the transition according to the migration plan, closely monitoring systems for any issues that arise.

**Example Scenario:** The transition to the new cloud-based patient management system is scheduled for a weekend to minimize disruption. The provider has a support team on standby to address any immediate post-migration issues.

#### Production

**Process:**

- After the migration, enter a period of heightened monitoring to quickly identify and rectify any operational issues.
- Establish new operational baselines and optimize cloud resource utilization to ensure cost-efficiency and performance.

**Example Scenario:** The provider monitors the performance of their cloud-based applications, adjusting resource allocation to meet the dynamic demands of healthcare delivery, and ensuring that the benefits of cloud migration are fully realized.

In this thorough approach, each phase builds on the previous, ensuring a methodical progression through the migration process. The healthcare provider can minimize risk and ensure continuity of care by carefully planning, executing, and monitoring each step of their cloud migration journey.
