### Password Rotation

AWS Secrets Manager's password rotation feature, particularly when integrated with AWS Lambda, provides an automated mechanism to rotate secrets like database passwords. This process enhances security by regularly changing passwords without manual intervention.

#### Understanding Password Rotation with Lambda in AWS Secrets Manager

##### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Setting Up the Secret:**
    
    - Initially, you store a secret (e.g., a database password) in Secrets Manager. This secret is encrypted and securely stored.
2. **Creating a Lambda Function:**
    
    - You create a Lambda function specifically designed to change the password. This function should be able to:
        - Connect to the database or service using the current secret.
        - Generate a new password.
        - Update the database or service with the new password.
3. **Configuring Rotation:**
    
    - In Secrets Manager, you configure rotation for the secret. This involves specifying the Lambda function to use for rotation and setting a rotation schedule (e.g., every 30 days).
4. **Rotation Trigger:**
    
    - When it's time for rotation (based on the schedule), Secrets Manager automatically triggers the Lambda function.
5. **Lambda Function Execution:**
    
    - The Lambda function executes its rotation logic:
        - It retrieves the current secret from Secrets Manager.
        - Generates a new password.
        - Updates the target database or service with this new password.
        - Then, it stores the new password back in Secrets Manager as the current version of the secret.
6. **Versioning of Secrets:**
    
    - Secrets Manager handles versioning of the secret. The old password is retained as an older version of the secret, while the new password becomes the "current" version.
7. **Application Updates:**
    
    - Applications using the secret must be configured to retrieve the latest version of the secret from Secrets Manager. This ensures they always use the current password.

#### Important Considerations:

1. **Lambda Function Permissions:**
    
    - Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the secret in Secrets Manager and to update the password in the database or service.
2. **Error Handling:**
    
    - The Lambda function should have proper error handling to deal with issues that might occur during the rotation process.
3. **Secrets Usage by Applications:**
    
    - Applications should be designed to handle the dynamic nature of rotating secrets, which includes being able to deal with password changes without downtime or manual updates.
4. **Testing Rotation:**
    
    - Thoroughly test the rotation process in a development or staging environment before enabling it in production to ensure that it works smoothly and does not disrupt services.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    
    - Enable logging and monitoring for the Lambda function to track the rotation process and receive alerts in case of failures.

AWS Secrets Manager itself does not come with a built-in Lambda function for password rotation. Instead, it provides the capability to integrate with AWS Lambda to automate the rotation process, but you are responsible for creating and configuring the Lambda function to handle the specific logic of rotating your secrets.

### Service Integration

AWS Secrets Manager offers direct integration with certain AWS services, such as Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), to facilitate seamless secret rotation, including password rotations. This integration is particularly valuable because it simplifies the process of keeping database credentials secure and up-to-date without extensive manual intervention.

#### Integration with Amazon RDS:

1. **Automatic Secret Rotation:**
    
    - For databases managed by Amazon RDS, Secrets Manager can automatically rotate the database credentials.
    - When you enable rotation for a secret associated with an RDS database, Secrets Manager automates the process of changing the password and synchronizing this change with the database.
2. **Supported RDS Databases:**
    
    - This feature is available for several database engines provided by RDS, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
    - For each supported database engine, Secrets Manager uses a predefined AWS Lambda function template tailored to handle the rotation process for that specific engine.
3. **Rotation Process:**
    
    - The rotation process generally involves creating a new password, setting it on the RDS database, and then updating the secret in Secrets Manager with the new credentials.
    - The service ensures that the database and the Secrets Manager are always in sync with the current credentials.

#### How to Set Up Integration:

1. **Creating a Secret for RDS Database:**
    
    - When you store the credentials for an RDS database in Secrets Manager, you specify the database it’s associated with.
2. **Enabling Rotation:**
    
    - Within the Secrets Manager console, you can enable rotation for a secret associated with an RDS database.
    - You can choose the rotation frequency (e.g., every 30 days).
3. **Using Lambda Function Templates:**
    
    - Secrets Manager prompts you to use the appropriate Lambda function for your RDS database engine.
    - This Lambda function is pre-configured to handle the password rotation process for the selected database engine.
4. **Granting Necessary Permissions:**
    
    - Ensure that the Lambda function has the required permissions to execute the rotation — this includes modifying the RDS instance and updating the secret.

#### Benefits of Direct Integration:

1. **Simplified Management:**
    
    - Direct integration with RDS simplifies the management of database credentials. The entire rotation process is automated, reducing the administrative burden.
2. **Enhanced Security:**
    
    - Frequent, automated rotation of database credentials enhances security by reducing the risk associated with static, long-term credentials.
3. **Consistency and Reliability:**
    
    - This integration ensures that the credentials used by your applications are always up to date, minimizing the risk of downtime due to credential discrepancies.
4. **Compliance:**
    
    - Automatic rotation can help in meeting compliance requirements that mandate regular password changes for sensitive systems like databases.

### Encryption

AWS Secrets Manager employs robust security measures to protect the secrets stored within it, with encryption being a key component. This encryption is primarily facilitated through integration with AWS Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring that the stored secrets are securely encrypted and managed.

#### Encryption in AWS Secrets Manager:

1. **Default Encryption:**
    
    - When you store a secret in Secrets Manager, it is automatically encrypted using the default encryption key provided by AWS KMS. This process happens without requiring explicit action from the user.
    - The default KMS key is managed by AWS and is used across various AWS services.
2. **Custom KMS Keys:**
    
    - For enhanced control and security, you can also choose to use a custom KMS key instead of the default key.
    - A custom KMS key is a key that you create, own, and manage in AWS KMS. Using a custom key allows you to define and control the encryption policies and usage permissions more granularly.
3. **Encryption Process:**
    
    - When a secret is stored in Secrets Manager, it is encrypted under the specified KMS key. This encryption ensures that the secret is stored in a ciphertext format, making it unreadable without the appropriate decryption permissions.
    - During the creation or update of a secret, Secrets Manager sends the plaintext data to KMS, which returns the encrypted data. Secrets Manager then stores this encrypted data.

#### Access and Decryption:

1. **Decryption on Access:**
    
    - When you retrieve a secret, Secrets Manager decrypts the secret value using the same KMS key and returns the plaintext value to you.
    - This decryption process is transparent, meaning you receive the secret in plaintext without needing to manually decrypt it.
2. **Permission Management:**
    
    - To access and decrypt the secret, the IAM (Identity and Access Management) policy must allow the user or application to use the specific KMS key.
    - This ensures that only entities with the appropriate permissions can decrypt and access the secret’s value.

#### Security and Compliance:

1. **Audit Trails:**
    
    - Using KMS for encryption allows you to leverage its auditing features. AWS CloudTrail, for instance, can be used to track the use of the KMS key, providing an audit trail for compliance and security monitoring.
2. **Key Rotation for KMS Keys:**
    
    - AWS KMS supports the rotation of encryption keys. You can configure your custom KMS key to rotate automatically once a year, which is a best practice for key management.
3. **Compliance Standards:**
    
    - The integration with KMS helps in meeting various compliance standards that mandate encryption of sensitive data using keys that are regularly rotated and access that is tightly controlled and monitored.
