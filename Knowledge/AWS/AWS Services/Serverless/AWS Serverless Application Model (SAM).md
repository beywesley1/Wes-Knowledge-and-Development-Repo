The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications on AWS. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. With SAM, you can define your serverless application with a few lines in a configuration file, which is then expanded into a full CloudFormation template.

### How AWS SAM Works

1. **SAM Template**:
    
    - It starts with a SAM template, which is an extension of AWS CloudFormation. This template defines your application's resources in a simple and clean syntax.
2. **Packaging and Deployment**:
    
    - The `sam package` command packages your application and uploads it to an S3 bucket. The `sam deploy` command then deploys your application using CloudFormation. This abstracts away much of the boilerplate code needed for setting up serverless applications.
3. **Local Testing**:
    
    - SAM CLI (Command Line Interface) allows developers to locally build, test, and debug applications defined by SAM templates. You can run your application locally in a Docker container that simulates the AWS runtime environment.
4. **Extensions to CloudFormation**:
    
    - SAM templates are an extension of AWS CloudFormation templates, with additional resources specifically designed for serverless applications, like `AWS::Serverless::Function` for AWS Lambda functions.

### Why It Was Designed

1. **Simplify Serverless Deployment**:
    
    - SAM was designed to make it easier to write serverless applications by providing a clean syntax to declare serverless resources, reducing the complexity of raw CloudFormation JSON or YAML.
2. **Streamline Development Process**:
    
    - The SAM CLI improves the development workflow by allowing local testing and debugging, streamlining the cycle of writing code and deploying it to AWS.
3. **Infrastructure as Code**:
    
    - SAM adheres to the infrastructure as code (IaC) principle, which means your serverless infrastructure is defined in templates that can be versioned and reused.
4. **Built-in Best Practices**:
    
    - It incorporates AWS's best practices for security and scalability by default. For example, it automatically handles the creation of IAM roles for Lambda functions.

### Fundamental Things to Understand About AWS SAM

1. **Components**:
    
    - SAM consists of the SAM template, the SAM CLI, and the application code. The template defines resources, while the CLI is used to manage the lifecycle of the application.
2. **Template Anatomy**:
    
    - A SAM template file typically includes sections for declaring AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway APIs, DynamoDB tables, and any event source mappings.
3. **Deployment Artifacts**:
    
    - The packaged application includes deployment artifacts such as Lambda code zips and Swagger files for APIs, which are uploaded to S3 for deployment.
4. **Compatibility with CloudFormation**:
    
    - SAM templates are an extension of CloudFormation templates, which means you can use standard CloudFormation resources and functions in a SAM template.
5. **Event Source Mappings**:
    
    - SAM simplifies the process of linking Lambda functions to event sources like API Gateway endpoints, S3 buckets, or DynamoDB tables.
6. **Transform Specification**:
    
    - SAM templates include a `Transform` section that specifies the SAM version being used, which allows the template to include SAM-specific resources.
7. **SAM vs. CloudFormation**:
    
    - While SAM is a subset of CloudFormation designed specifically for serverless applications, CloudFormation is a broader service capable of managing a wide array of AWS resources.

### SAM Template

The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template is a configuration file that follows the YAML format. It's used to define the serverless resources you want to deploy. Let's go into the details of what comprises a SAM template.

#### Template Anatomy

A SAM template is an extension of AWS CloudFormation templates and follows a similar structure, with a few additions specific to serverless applications:

1. **AWSTemplateFormatVersion**: This defines the version of the CloudFormation template format that your template conforms to. It is usually set to "2010-09-09".
    
2. **Transform**: This required field specifies that the template is a SAM template. It's used to include the SAM-specific resources and should be set to 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'.
    
3. **Globals**: This optional section is unique to SAM and allows you to define properties that are common to multiple serverless resources, such as the runtime or memory size for all AWS Lambda functions in your template.
    
4. **Resources**: This mandatory section declares the AWS resources that you want to create. SAM introduces new resource types such as `AWS::Serverless::Function`, `AWS::Serverless::Api`, and `AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable`.
    
5. **Outputs**: Similar to CloudFormation, this optional section specifies the output values that you can import into other stacks (if you're using nested stacks) or return in response.

#### Serverless Resource Types

Within the `Resources` section, you can specify serverless resources. Here are some of the key ones:

1. **AWS::Serverless::Function**: Defines a serverless function (typically a Lambda function). You can specify properties such as the code URI, the event triggers, runtime, environment variables, and more.
    
2. **AWS::Serverless::Api**: Declares an API Gateway resource linked to your Lambda functions, allowing you to define the path, method, and integration type for the API endpoints.
    
3. **AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable**: Creates a DynamoDB table with a primary key. This is a simplified resource for use cases where you need a basic NoSQL table without complex configurations.
    
4. **AWS::Serverless::Application**: Allows you to embed applications from AWS Serverless Application Repository or applications defined by other SAM templates.

#### Example SAM Template Snippet

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'
Globals:
  Function:
    Timeout: 3
Resources:
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs12.x
      CodeUri: s3://bucket/my-function.zip
      Events:
        MyApi:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /my-path
            Method: get
Outputs:
  MyFunctionApi:
    Description: "API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ServerlessRestApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/my-path/"
```

In this snippet:

- `Globals` sets a default timeout of 3 seconds for all Lambda functions in the template.
- `MyLambdaFunction` is an `AWS::Serverless::Function` resource. It specifies the function handler, runtime, and location of the code. It also defines an API event source mapping with a specific path and method.
- `Outputs` section provides the API Gateway endpoint URL that's generated by the `MyApi` event source.

#### Working with SAM Template

When you deploy a SAM template using the SAM CLI, it will transform the template into a full CloudFormation template behind the scenes. This expanded template is then used to provision the actual AWS resources.

### SAM CLI

The AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is a tool provided by AWS that enables developers to manage the lifecycle of serverless applications written with AWS SAM. It allows you to create, build, test, and deploy serverless applications using familiar development tools.

#### How SAM CLI Works

1. **Project Initialization**:
    
    - `sam init`: Initializes a new serverless application with a SAM template and example application code in your chosen runtime and dependency manager.
2. **Local Testing and Debugging**:
    
    - `sam local invoke`: Invokes a Lambda function locally, simulating an invocation in the AWS cloud.
    - `sam local start-api`: Runs your API Gateway locally, allowing you to test HTTP request/response functionality through local endpoints.
    - `sam local generate-event`: Generates sample event payloads for various AWS services, which you can use to test your Lambda functions with event data similar to what they'd receive in the AWS environment.
3. **Building the Application**:
    
    - `sam build`: Processes your SAM template and application code, resolving dependencies and preparing your application to be deployed to AWS.
4. **Packaging and Deployment**:
    
    - `sam package`: Packages your application and uploads it to an Amazon S3 bucket. It also generates a new SAM file that's ready for deployment.
    - `sam deploy`: Deploys your serverless application using AWS CloudFormation, creating and managing the necessary infrastructure and resources.

#### How to Use SAM CLI

To effectively use the SAM CLI, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Install the SAM CLI**: You need to have the SAM CLI installed on your local development machine. It can be installed via various methods like pip, Homebrew, or by downloading the binaries directly.
    
2. **Initialize a New Application**:
    
    - Run `sam init` to start a new project with boilerplate code and a SAM template.
3. **Develop Your Application**:
    
    - Write your application code and define your infrastructure as code within the SAM template.
4. **Build Your Application**:
    
    - Execute `sam build` to build your application. This resolves dependencies and creates deployment artifacts.
5. **Test Locally**:
    
    - Use `sam local invoke` to test individual Lambda functions or `sam local start-api` to test full API interactions.
6. **Package for Deployment**:
    
    - Run `sam package` to upload your code to S3 and prepare it for deployment. You'll specify the S3 bucket and receive a packaged template in return.
7. **Deploy to AWS**:
    
    - Use `sam deploy` to deploy your application to AWS. You will specify the stack name, any required capabilities, and possibly parameter overrides.
8. **Iterate**:
    
    - Continue developing and testing your application locally, iterating over your functions and API until you're ready for another deployment.

#### Additional SAM CLI Commands and Features

- **Logs**: `sam logs` allows you to fetch logs generated by your Lambda functions from Amazon CloudWatch Logs directly from the command line.
    
- **Validation**: `sam validate` validates a SAM template against the SAM specification and AWS CloudFormation standards to ensure it is ready for deployment.
    
- **Tail Logs**: You can tail logs in real-time from your command line while invoking functions locally or on AWS.
    
- **Layer Management**: The CLI also helps in managing Lambda Layers, which are components that can contain libraries, custom runtimes, or other dependencies.
