This serverless architecture is for a fictional real-world application: a "Personal Hydration Reminder System" designed to ensure individuals are drinking enough water throughout the day.

### Static Website

- **Function**: Hosts a user interface for individuals to log their water intake.
- **AWS Service**: Amazon S3 hosts the website, providing a simple, reliable, and serverless way to serve the static content.
- **Scenario Role**: Users, like Bob, access this website to track the amount of water they drink. Bob logs that he's consumed a glass of water first thing in the morning.

Creating a static website for the "Personal Hydration Reminder System" involves developing a simple HTML page with JavaScript to interact with the AWS services via API Gateway. Below is an example of how such a page might look, including code comments explaining each part:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hydration Reminder System</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Track Your Water Intake</h1>

<!-- Water Intake Form -->
<form id="waterIntakeForm">
    <label for="waterAmount">Enter the amount of water you drank (in ounces):</label>
    <input type="number" id="waterAmount" name="waterAmount" min="1" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Log Water Intake">
</form>

<script>
// This script will be executed when the user submits the water intake form.
$('#waterIntakeForm').on('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submit action.

    var waterAmount = $('#waterAmount').val(); // Get the amount of water from the form.

    // Make an AJAX POST request to the API Gateway endpoint.
    // This endpoint triggers a Lambda function to process the water intake data.
    $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: 'https://your-api-gateway-url/dev/log-water-intake', // Replace with your API Gateway URL.
        contentType: 'application/json',
        data: JSON.stringify({ "waterAmount": waterAmount }),
        success: function(response) {
            alert('Water intake logged successfully!'); // Alert the user of success.
            // Here you might want to update the UI to reflect the logged water intake.
        },
        error: function(err) {
            alert('Error logging water intake. Please try again.'); // Alert the user of an error.
        }
    });
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- The HTML provides a simple form where users can input the amount of water they have drunk.
- The JavaScript uses jQuery to handle the form submission. When the form is submitted, it prevents the page from reloading (`e.preventDefault()`).
- It then captures the amount of water inputted (`var waterAmount = $('#waterAmount').val();`).
- An AJAX request is made to an API Gateway endpoint (`url: 'https://your-api-gateway-url/dev/log-water-intake'`). This URL should be replaced with the actual endpoint URL provided by API Gateway.
- The request type is POST, meaning we are sending data to the server. The data sent is the `waterAmount` in JSON format.
- On successful logging (`success`), an alert is shown to the user. Optionally, the page can be updated to reflect the new state.
- On failure (`error`), an error message is displayed.

To host this webpage on Amazon S3:

1. Save the HTML code as an `index.html` file.
2. Create a new S3 bucket through the AWS Management Console.
3. Enable static website hosting for the bucket.
4. Upload the `index.html` file to the bucket.
5. Set the bucket policy to make the content publicly readable.
6. Use the provided S3 endpoint to access your new static site.

By hosting this webpage on S3, you benefit from AWS’s scalable infrastructure without managing servers. The page interacts with API Gateway, which in turn triggers the backend AWS Lambda function to process and log the water intake.
### API Gateway

- **Function**: Serves as the doorway for the serverless backend to receive HTTP requests from the static website.
- **AWS Service**: Amazon API Gateway processes these requests and triggers AWS Lambda functions.
- **Scenario Role**: When Bob logs his water intake on the website, API Gateway captures this event and invokes a backend Lambda function to process the data.

To expand on the serverless backend, we'll need to create an API Gateway endpoint that will trigger a Lambda function responsible for processing the water intake data logged by the user. Here's how you would set this up:

#### API Gateway Setup

1. **Create a New API**:
    
    - Navigate to the Amazon API Gateway console and create a new REST API.
    - Define a new resource, for example, `/log-water-intake`.
    - Create a new POST method for the `/log-water-intake` resource.
2. **Configure the POST Method**:
    
    - Select "Lambda Function" as the integration type.
    - Specify the region and the name of the Lambda function that will process the water intake data.
3. **Deploy the API**:
    
    - Create a new stage, e.g., `dev`, and deploy your API to this stage.
    - Note the invoke URL provided after deployment, which will be used in your static website's AJAX call.
4. **Set Up CORS**:
    
    - Enable CORS on your `/log-water-intake` resource to allow your S3-hosted static site to call the API Gateway endpoint.

#### Example Lambda Function (Python)

Below is an example of a Lambda function that could be triggered by the API Gateway to process water intake data:

```python
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Parse the incoming JSON data from the API Gateway
    water_amount = json.loads(event['body']).get('water_amount')

    # Here you might implement logic to store the data in a database,
    # like Amazon DynamoDB, or perform some processing.
    # For simplicity, we'll just print it.
    print(f"Received water intake: {water_amount} ounces")

    # Optionally, you could also implement logic to check if the user
    # has met their daily water intake goal and trigger another process.

    # Return a success response to the API Gateway
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Water intake logged successfully.')
    }
```

In this example:

- The Lambda function is written in Python and expects a JSON payload from the API Gateway.
- It extracts the `water_amount` from the payload (`water_amount = json.loads(event['body']).get('water_amount')`).
- The function simply prints the received water amount to the logs (`print(f"Received water intake: {water_amount} ounces")`). In a real application, you might store this data in a database like DynamoDB.
- It returns a JSON response indicating success, which the API Gateway forwards back to the user's browser.

#### Integrating the API with the Static Site

You would then modify the static website's AJAX call to point to the deployed API Gateway endpoint:

```javascript
$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: 'https://your-api-gateway-url/dev/log-water-intake', // Use the invoke URL for the API Gateway endpoint.
    contentType: 'application/json',
    data: JSON.stringify({ "water_amount": waterAmount }),
    // ...
});
```

Make sure to replace `https://your-api-gateway-url/dev/log-water-intake` with the actual invoke URL of your deployed API Gateway endpoint.

With this setup, when a user like Bob logs his water intake on the website, the static site's JavaScript code sends an HTTP POST request to the API Gateway. The Gateway then invokes the Lambda function, passing along the water intake data for processing. The Lambda function can log this data, perform any necessary calculations or storage, and return a response back to the user. This serverless architecture provides a scalable and efficient way to handle user data without the need for provisioning or managing servers.
### API Lambda (API_Lambda)

- **Function**: Processes incoming API requests, in this case, water intake data.
- **AWS Service**: AWS Lambda executes the logic without provisioning servers manually.
- **Scenario Role**: The `API_Lambda` function evaluates Bob's water intake and compares it to the recommended daily amount. If Bob hasn’t reached his target, the function triggers a state machine to initiate a reminder process.

Expanding on the AWS Lambda function, let's create a function that not only logs the water intake but also decides whether to trigger a reminder process using AWS Step Functions if the user hasn't reached their daily water intake goal.

```python
import json
import boto3

# Initialize the client for AWS Step Functions
stepfunctions_client = boto3.client('stepfunctions')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Assume the event is the direct JSON payload from API Gateway
    water_intake_data = json.loads(event['body'])

    # Extract the user ID and water amount from the payload
    user_id = water_intake_data['user_id']
    water_amount = int(water_intake_data['water_amount'])
    
    # Define the recommended daily water intake in ounces
    recommended_intake_oz = 64

    # Placeholder for function that fetches the current daily total from a data store
    current_daily_total = get_current_daily_total(user_id)

    # Update the current daily total with the new water intake amount
    current_daily_total += water_amount
    # Placeholder for function that updates the current daily total in a data store
    update_current_daily_total(user_id, current_daily_total)

    # Check if the updated daily total is less than the recommended amount
    if current_daily_total < recommended_intake_oz:
        # The user has not reached their daily goal, trigger the reminder state machine
        response = stepfunctions_client.start_execution(
            stateMachineArn='arn:aws:states:region:account-id:stateMachine:YourStateMachineName',
            name='hydration-reminder-for-' + user_id,
            input=json.dumps({
                "user_id": user_id,
                "current_daily_total": current_daily_total,
                "recommended_intake_oz": recommended_intake_oz
            })
        )
        # Log the state machine execution
        print(f"Started state machine for hydration reminder: {response['executionArn']}")

    # Return a success response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'message': 'Water intake logged and processed successfully.',
            'currentDailyTotal': current_daily_total
        })
    }

def get_current_daily_total(user_id):
    # Placeholder logic to retrieve the current daily total for the user
    # In a real implementation, this might query a database like DynamoDB
    return 0

def update_current_daily_total(user_id, new_total):
    # Placeholder logic to update the current daily total for the user
    # In a real implementation, this might update a record in DynamoDB
    pass
```

In this example:

- The function receives an API Gateway event with the user's water intake data.
- It extracts the `user_id` and `water_amount` from the incoming data.
- It checks the current daily total against the recommended intake. For simplicity, `get_current_daily_total` and `update_current_daily_total` are placeholders for data retrieval and update operations, respectively.
- If the user hasn't met the daily recommended intake, the Lambda function triggers an AWS Step Functions state machine using the `stepfunctions_client.start_execution` method. It passes the necessary data as input to the state machine.
- The state machine ARN is specified with a placeholder ARN. This should be replaced with the actual ARN of your state machine in AWS Step Functions.
- The function returns a success response, including the current daily total of water intake.

In a real-world application, you would replace the placeholders with code to interact with a persistent data store, such as Amazon DynamoDB, to fetch and update the user's current daily water intake. The state machine that gets triggered could then perform various actions, such as sending a reminder notification to the user if they haven't logged enough water by a certain time of the day.
### State Machine (Hydration Reminder System)

- **Function**: Manages the workflow for sending hydration reminders.
- **AWS Service**: AWS Step Functions orchestrates the reminders, allowing a sequence of events that includes a delay and then a notification if needed.
- **Scenario Role**: The "Hydration Reminder System" checks if Bob's water intake is below the daily goal and starts a timer to wait before sending a reminder.

To set up a "Hydration Reminder System" using AWS Step Functions, you would need to define a state machine that can evaluate whether a user has met their daily hydration goal and decide when to send a reminder. Below is an outline of how to configure this state machine and ensure it interacts with the Lambda function designed to trigger it.

#### Step Functions State Machine Configuration

1. **Define State Machine**:
    
    - Create a state machine in AWS Step Functions using Amazon States Language, a JSON-based, structured configuration language.
    - The state machine will have states for decision-making (choice state), waiting (wait state), and sending reminders (task state).
2. **States Configuration**:
    
    - **Choice State**: Evaluates the user's current water intake against their daily goal. If the intake is below the goal, it transitions to a wait state; otherwise, it ends the execution.
    - **Wait State**: Pauses the state machine based on a predefined timer (e.g., wait until the end of the day) before sending a reminder.
    - **Task State**: Triggers another Lambda function designed to send the hydration reminder via email or another notification system.

#### Example State Machine Definition

```json
{
  "Comment": "Hydration Reminder State Machine",
  "StartAt": "CheckHydrationGoal",
  "States": {
    "CheckHydrationGoal": {
      "Type": "Choice",
      "Choices": [
        {
          "Variable": "$.current_daily_total",
          "NumericLessThan": "$.recommended_intake_oz",
          "Next": "WaitForReminderTime"
        }
      ],
      "Default": "HydrationGoalMet"
    },
    "WaitForReminderTime": {
      "Type": "Wait",
      "TimestampPath": "$.reminder_time",
      "Next": "SendHydrationReminder"
    },
    "SendHydrationReminder": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:send_reminder_lambda",
      "End": true
    },
    "HydrationGoalMet": {
      "Type": "Pass",
      "Result": "No reminder needed, hydration goal met.",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```

In this definition:

- The `CheckHydrationGoal` choice state checks if the `current_daily_total` is less than the `recommended_intake_oz`. If true, it moves to the `WaitForReminderTime` state.
- The `WaitForReminderTime` wait state delays the execution until the specified `reminder_time`.
- The `SendHydrationReminder` task state invokes the `send_reminder_lambda` Lambda function to send the reminder.
- The `HydrationGoalMet` state ends the execution if the hydration goal has been met.

#### Interaction with the Lambda Function

The Lambda function previously described is responsible for invoking this state machine. When the function determines that the user's water intake is below the daily goal, it starts an execution of this state machine by calling the `start_execution` method of the AWS Step Functions client, passing in the necessary input:

```python
response = stepfunctions_client.start_execution(
    stateMachineArn='arn:aws:states:region:account-id:stateMachine:YourStateMachineName',
    name='hydration-reminder-for-' + user_id,
    input=json.dumps({
        "user_id": user_id,
        "current_daily_total": current_daily_total,
        "recommended_intake_oz": recommended_intake_oz,
        "reminder_time": "2021-12-31T23:59:00Z"  # An example static reminder time
    })
)
```

The `input` parameter includes all the information that the state machine needs to make decisions, such as the `current_daily_total` and `recommended_intake_oz`, along with a `reminder_time` that indicates when the user should be reminded to drink more water.

This state machine is a scalable, low-maintenance solution that automates user reminders for hydration. It works hand-in-hand with Lambda functions to provide a seamless serverless workflow that can adapt to various user behaviors and patterns.


### Timer

- **Function**: Introduces a delay before the next action, giving Bob time to log additional water intake.
- **AWS Service**: A built-in feature of AWS Step Functions, which can pause the execution according to a set duration.
- **Scenario Role**: The State Machine initiates a timer, giving Bob a couple of hours to drink more water before receiving a reminder.

In the scenario we've been constructing, the AWS Step Functions state machine includes a wait state to delay the execution of a reminder action. This allows time for the user, Bob, to meet his daily hydration goal before the system sends out a reminder.

#### Example Wait State in Step Functions

Here's an example of how a wait state can be configured within the AWS Step Functions state machine for our hydration reminder scenario:
```json
{
  "WaitForReminderTime": {
    "Type": "Wait",
    "SecondsPath": "$.wait_seconds",
    "Next": "SendHydrationReminder"
  },
  "SendHydrationReminder": {
    "Type": "Task",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:send_reminder_lambda",
    "End": true
  }
}
```

In this state machine definition:

- The `WaitForReminderTime` state uses the `SecondsPath` property to dynamically set the wait duration based on the input to the state machine. The input would include a `wait_seconds` field specifying how long the state machine should wait before moving on to the next state. This field is populated by the Lambda function that initiates the state machine.
- After the wait period, the state machine transitions to the `SendHydrationReminder` state, which triggers a Lambda function to send Bob a reminder to drink more water.

#### Scenario Example

Suppose Bob logs his water intake through the static website at 9 AM, and he has set a personal goal to drink 64 ounces of water by the end of the day. By 3 PM, Bob has only logged 32 ounces. The Lambda function that processes the water intake checks the total against Bob's goal and starts an execution of the state machine because Bob hasn't reached the target yet.

The input to the state machine would include a wait time that provides Bob with a few more hours to log additional water intake before receiving a reminder. For example, if the system is set to remind him two hours before the day's end, the `wait_seconds` would be calculated accordingly:

In this `WaitForReminderTime` state:

- `"Type": "Wait"` declares this as a wait state, which introduces a pause in the execution.
- `"SecondsPath": "$.wait_seconds"` uses the value found in the input data at the `wait_seconds` key to determine how long to wait. This value would be dynamically calculated based on when Bob last logged his water intake and the time by which he needs to finish his daily goal.


```python
import datetime

# ... (inside the Lambda function)

# Calculate the number of seconds until two hours before midnight
reminder_time = datetime.datetime.now().replace(hour=22, minute=0, second=0) - datetime.datetime.now()
wait_seconds = int(reminder_time.total_seconds())

# ... (start the execution of the state machine with this wait_seconds value)
```

Bob's state machine execution would then pause until two hours before midnight. If Bob logs more water before the timer expires, the Lambda function can update the state machine execution to reflect that the daily goal has been met. If not, once the timer expires, the `SendHydrationReminder` state is triggered, and Bob receives an email reminder to drink more water before the day ends.

This setup allows Bob to receive timely reminders based on his personal hydration goals, ensuring he stays well-hydrated throughout the day. The use of the "Wait" state in the state machine provides a flexible means to set reminder intervals that can be adjusted to each individual's needs.
### Email Reminder Lambda (email_reminder_lambda)

- **Function**: Sends an email reminder to Bob if he hasn’t logged sufficient water intake after the timer.
- **AWS Service**: Another Lambda function that is executed by the state machine when the timer ends.
- **Scenario Role**: If Bob doesn’t log additional water intake within the set period, the `email_reminder_lambda` sends him a friendly email reminder.
  
  #### Example Lambda Function

```python
import boto3
import json
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract relevant data from the event
    user_email = event['user_email']  # User's email to send reminder to
    current_intake = event['current_daily_total']  # Current daily water intake
    target_intake = event['target_daily_total']  # Target daily water intake

    # Initialize SES client
    ses_client = boto3.client('ses', region_name='us-east-1')  # Update the region as needed

    # Email subject and body
    subject = "Hydration Reminder: Time to Drink More Water!"
    body_text = (
        f"Hello,\n\n"
        f"We noticed you've only logged {current_intake} ounces of water today. "
        f"Don't forget your goal is to reach {target_intake} ounces of water each day for optimal hydration. "
        f"Grab a glass of water and stay hydrated!\n\n"
        f"Cheers,\n"
        f"Your Hydration Reminder System"
    )
    body_html = (
        f"<html>"
        f"<head></head>"
        f"<body>"
        f"<h1>Hydration Reminder: Time to Drink More Water!</h1>"
        f"<p>We noticed you've only logged <b>{current_intake} ounces</b> of water today. "
        f"Don't forget your goal is to reach <b>{target_intake} ounces</b> of water each day for optimal hydration. "
        f"Grab a glass of water and stay hydrated!</p>"
        f"<p>Cheers,<br>"
        f"Your Hydration Reminder System</p>"
        f"</body>"
        f"</html>"
    )

    try:
        # Send the email
        response = ses_client.send_email(
            Source='sender@example.com',  # This email must be verified with Amazon SES.
            Destination={
                'ToAddresses': [
                    user_email
                ]
            },
            Message={
                'Subject': {
                    'Data': subject
                },
                'Body': {
                    'Text': {
                        'Data': body_text
                    },
                    'Html': {
                        'Data': body_html
                    }
                }
            }
        )
    except ClientError as e:
        print(e.response['Error']['Message'])
        raise e
    else:
        print(f"Email sent to {user_email}! Message ID: {response['MessageId']}")

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(f"Email sent to {user_email} successfully.")
    }
```

In this `email_reminder_lambda` function:

- The `event` object is expected to contain `user_email`, `current_daily_total`, and `target_daily_total`, which are passed in by the state machine when it invokes this Lambda function.
- An SES client is instantiated, and the `send_email` method is used to construct and send an email to the user's email address.
- The email includes both plain text (`body_text`) and HTML (`body_html`) versions of the message.
- The source email address (`'sender@example.com'`) must be a verified sender in Amazon SES.
- If sending the email succeeds, the function prints the message ID to the AWS Lambda logs. If it fails, it raises an exception with the error message from SES.
- It returns a status code of 200 and a message indicating successful email sending.

This Lambda function would be triggered automatically by the Step Functions state machine if the hydration goal is not met by the specified time. It's a crucial part of ensuring users like Bob are reminded to stay hydrated throughout the day.
### Simple Email Service (SES)

- **Function**: Handles the delivery of email reminders.
- **AWS Service**: Amazon SES is a scalable email sending service, ideal for sending notifications.
- **Scenario Role**: Amazon SES is utilized by the `email_reminder_lambda` to send Bob an email to remind him to stay hydrated.

### High-Level Workflow Summary

In this "Personal Hydration Reminder System," when a user like Bob logs water intake via the static website, the data is processed through API Gateway and the `API_Lambda`. If Bob hasn't reached his daily water intake goal, the State Machine initiates a countdown. If he doesn’t update his intake within the set timeframe, the `email_reminder_lambda` uses SES to send him a hydration reminder.
