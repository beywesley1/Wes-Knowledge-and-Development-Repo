Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a crowdsourcing marketplace that enables businesses and developers to access a diverse, on-demand, scalable workforce. It allows individuals (known as "Workers") to perform tasks that require human intelligence, often referred to as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs).

### How Mechanical Turk Works

1. **Task Creation**:
    
    - Requesters (businesses or individuals) create tasks (HITs) that require human judgment, such as data validation, content moderation, survey participation, or image recognition.
    - These tasks are then published on the MTurk platform.
2. **Task Completion by Workers**:
    
    - Workers from around the world can browse available HITs and choose tasks to complete based on their skills and interests.
    - Once a Worker completes a task, they submit it for approval.
3. **Approval and Payment**:
    
    - The Requester reviews the completed work and can approve or reject it based on quality.
    - Approved tasks are paid for by the Requester, and Workers receive compensation for their work.

#### Use Cases for Mechanical Turk

1. **Data Validation and Cleanup**:
    
    - Workers can check datasets for accuracy, clean up data, or categorize items, which is particularly useful for machine learning and AI training datasets.

### Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk

Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) are individuals who earn money by completing Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) posted by Requesters. They play a crucial role in the MTurk ecosystem by providing the human judgment and skills necessary to complete tasks that are difficult to automate.

#### How Workers Earn by Completing HITs

1. **Finding and Selecting HITs**:
    
    - Workers browse the MTurk marketplace to find available HITs. They can select tasks based on their skills, interests, and the payment offered.
    - Workers may also qualify for certain HITs by completing qualification tests or meeting specific criteria set by the Requester (like a certain approval rate).
2. **Completing Tasks**:
    
    - Once a Worker selects a HIT, they complete the task according to the instructions provided. This could involve tasks like categorizing images, transcribing audio, or participating in surveys.
    - The complexity and time required for each HIT can vary, from simple tasks taking just a few minutes to more involved tasks that require longer commitment.
3. **Submitting Work for Approval**:
    
    - After completing a HIT, the Worker submits their work to the Requester for review.
    - The Requester then evaluates the completed task and decides whether to approve or reject it based on quality and adherence to the instructions.
4. **Payment**:
    
    - For each approved HIT, the Worker earns the amount specified by the Requester. This payment is credited to their MTurk account.
    - Workers can transfer their earnings to a bank account or to an Amazon.com gift card balance, depending on their location and preferences.
5. **Building Reputation**:
    
    - Workers build their reputation on the platform through their approval rate and the number of HITs completed. A higher approval rate and more completed HITs can qualify them for a broader range of tasks and potentially higher-paying HITs.

#### Things to Know for Workers

- **Variability of Work**: The availability and type of HITs can vary, and Workers often need to be selective to find tasks that match their skills and payment expectations.
- **Fair Compensation**: Workers should be mindful of the time required for each HIT versus the payment offered to ensure fair compensation for their effort.

### Pricing and Payments on Amazon Mechanical Turk

Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) operates on a pay-per-task model, where Requesters set the payment for each Human Intelligence Task (HIT) they post. Understanding the pricing and payment system is crucial for both Requesters and Workers on the platform.

#### Pay Per Task

1. **Setting Prices by Requesters**:
    
    - Requesters decide the payment amount for each HIT they create. This amount should ideally reflect the complexity and time required to complete the task.
    - Requesters also pay a fee to Amazon for each HIT. This fee varies based on the type of task and the number of assignments per HIT.
2. **Earnings for Workers**:
    
    - Workers earn the specified amount for each HIT they complete and is approved by the Requester.
    - It's important for Workers to consider the time required for a HIT relative to the payment to ensure that the work is fairly compensated.

#### How Pricing Works

1. **Standard Pricing**:
    
    - Amazon charges Requesters a standard fee of 20% on the reward paid for a HIT, with a minimum of $0.01 per assignment.
    - For HITs with 10 or more assignments, the fee increases to 40%.
2. **Specialized Tasks**:
    
    - For tasks requiring Master Workers, Amazon charges a higher fee due to the specialized nature of these tasks and the higher qualification requirements of the Workers.

#### How Payments Work

1. **Worker Payments**:
    
    - Once a HIT is completed and approved, the Worker’s earnings are credited to their MTurk account.
    - Workers can transfer their earnings to a bank account or Amazon.com gift card balance, depending on their location and account settings.
2. **Requester Payments**:
    
    - Requesters fund their MTurk account to pay for the HITs they post. This includes the cost of the HITs themselves plus the associated Amazon fees.
    - Payments for approved HITs are automatically deducted from the Requester's prepaid MTurk account balance.
3. **Minimum Payment Thresholds**:
    
    - Workers often have a minimum earnings threshold that they must reach before they can transfer funds out of their MTurk account.
4. **Payment Processing Time**:
    
    - There may be processing times involved both in the approval of HITs by Requesters and in the transfer of funds to Workers’ bank accounts or gift card balances.

### AWS Mechanical Turk Qualifications

In Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), qualifications are used to ensure that Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) are completed by Workers who meet specific criteria. Qualifications serve as a way for Requesters to define and enforce prerequisites for Workers attempting their tasks.

#### What are Qualifications?

1. **Criteria Set by Requesters**: Qualifications are requirements that Workers must meet to work on a particular HIT. These can include factors like approval rate, location, completion of a qualification test, or having completed a certain number of HITs.
    
2. **Customizable**: Requesters can create custom qualifications specific to their needs. This allows them to target Workers with the right skills or experience for their tasks.
    
3. **Qualification Tests**: Requesters can set up qualification tests that Workers must pass to earn a qualification. These tests assess a Worker's ability to complete the type of task the Requester is posting.

#### How Qualifications Work

1. **Assigning Qualifications**: When creating a HIT, Requesters specify the qualifications required. Workers who don't meet these qualifications won't see the HIT in their available tasks.
    
2. **Filtering Workers**: Qualifications effectively filter the pool of Workers, ensuring that only those who meet certain standards or criteria can accept and submit the HIT.
    
3. **Quality Control**: They are a key tool for quality control, as they help Requesters ensure that their tasks are being completed by capable and qualified individuals.

#### Example Scenario: Market Research Survey

**Fictional Scenario**: A company wants to conduct a market research survey targeting young adults who are tech-savvy and based in the United States.

1. **Setting Up the HIT**: The company sets up a HIT on MTurk for the survey, specifying that only Workers who meet their criteria can participate.
    
2. **Defining Qualifications**:
    
    - **Demographic Qualification**: The company requires that Workers be within the age range of 18-30 years. They set up a qualification that includes age verification.
    - **Location Qualification**: They also require that Workers are based in the United States. This can be a standard qualification available on MTurk.
    - **Tech-Savviness Test**: To ensure Workers are tech-savvy, the company creates a short qualification test that includes questions about technology usage and trends.
3. **Qualification Test and Approval**: Workers interested in the survey must first take and pass the tech-savviness test. Upon passing, they are granted the qualification and can then access and complete the survey HIT.
    
4. **Survey Completion and Payment**: Qualified Workers complete the survey. The company reviews the submissions, approves the completed surveys, and processes payments to the Workers.
