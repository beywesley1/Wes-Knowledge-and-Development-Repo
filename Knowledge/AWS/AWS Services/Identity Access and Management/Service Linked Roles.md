AWS Service Linked Roles are a type of IAM (Identity and Access Management) role that links directly to specific AWS services. These roles are predefined by AWS and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. They offer a secure way for AWS services to access resources in your account without requiring you to manage the necessary permissions.

### How Do AWS Service Linked Roles Work?

1. **Automatic Creation and Management:**
    
    - Certain AWS services will automatically create a Service Linked Role in your AWS account the first time the service needs to perform actions on your behalf.
2. **Predefined Permissions:**
    
    - AWS defines the permissions of Service Linked Roles based on the serviceâ€™s requirements, which reduces the need for you to understand and manage specific permissions for each service.
3. **Security Best Practices:**
    
    - These roles follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the permissions necessary for the linked AWS service to perform its tasks.
4. **Audit and Compliance:**
    
    - Actions taken by the service using the Service Linked Role can be traced through AWS CloudTrail, which provides an audit trail for compliance.
5. **Non-transferable:**
    
    - Service Linked Roles are tied to the service for which they are created and cannot be repurposed for other services, adding an extra layer of security.

#### Use Cases for AWS Service Linked Roles

1. **Simplified Service Management:**
    
    - AWS services that require permissions to other AWS services can manage those permissions automatically without user intervention.
2. **Secure Delegation:**
    
    - Service Linked Roles enable secure delegation of access to AWS services that need to perform tasks on behalf of the user, without sharing security credentials.
3. **Automated Scaling and Management:**
    
    - Services like AWS Auto Scaling use Service Linked Roles to adjust resources in response to demand securely.

### What is Organizations Trusted Access?

AWS Organizations Trusted Access is a feature that allows you to enable other AWS services to perform tasks in the organizational units (OUs) and accounts within your organization. It provides a way to establish trust between your AWS Organization and specific AWS services that need to work across multiple accounts.

#### How Trusted Access Relates to Service Linked Roles

- **Integration Point:**
    
    - Trusted Access is often the mechanism that allows the service to create and manage the Service Linked Role within your accounts.
- **Enabling and Disabling Access:**
    
    - As an administrative user, you can enable or disable Trusted Access between your organization and a service, which will allow or prevent the service from creating and using a Service Linked Role in your accounts.
- **Cross-Account Operations:**
    
    - For services that operate across multiple accounts, like AWS Security Hub or AWS Config, Trusted Access ensures that these services have the necessary permissions to perform actions and access data within each account via the Service Linked Role.

AWS Service Linked Roles are used by a wide variety of AWS services to perform actions on your behalf securely. Here are some examples of AWS services that utilize Service Linked Roles:

1. **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**: To manage the scaling of EC2 instances, this service uses a Service Linked Role to launch or terminate instances based on your scaling policies.
    
2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For deploying and managing applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications, Elastic Beanstalk uses Service Linked Roles to manage resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.
    
3. **AWS CloudFormation**: This service uses Service Linked Roles to manage resources when creating and managing stacks of AWS resources based on templates.
    
4. **Amazon RDS**: The Relational Database Service uses Service Linked Roles to manage backups, read replicas, and other database management tasks on your behalf.
    
5. **AWS Directory Service**: To perform tasks such as setting up a trust relationship between an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory and an on-premises Active Directory, Directory Service requires a Service Linked Role.
    
6. **Amazon Lex**: For building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text, Amazon Lex uses Service Linked Roles to invoke Lambda functions and other AWS services as part of the conversation flow.
    
7. **AWS Config**: This service assesses, audits, and evaluates the configurations of your AWS resources, using a Service Linked Role to record configuration changes to those resources.
    
8. **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: For orchestrating Docker containers, ECS uses Service Linked Roles to allow the ECS agent to make calls to the AWS APIs on your behalf.
    
9. **AWS CodeDeploy**: It automates code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and instances running on-premises, using a Service Linked Role to interact with other AWS services required during deployment.
    
10. **Amazon SageMaker**: For building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale, SageMaker uses Service Linked Roles to access data in S3 buckets and manage other resources.
    
11. **AWS Glue**: This is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it simple and cost-effective to categorize your data, clean it, enrich it, and move it reliably between various data stores, using Service Linked Roles to access resources it needs to manage the ETL jobs.
    
12. **AWS Backup**: This service simplifies backup management by allowing you to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services, using Service Linked Roles to access the resources that need to be backed up.
