AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that makes it easy for companies to host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure.

#### How Does CodeCommit Work?

1. **Repository Hosting**: CodeCommit allows you to create and manage Git repositories in the cloud. It offers a secure place for storing code, binary files, and metadata.
    
2. **Collaboration and Code Review**: Multiple developers can collaborate on a codebase. They can share, discuss, and review code changes within the repository. CodeCommit supports pull requests and comments, enabling a collaborative review process.
    
3. **Integration with AWS Services**: CodeCommit can be integrated with other AWS services such as CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline, creating a seamless development workflow from code storage to deployment.
    
4. **Scalability and Durability**: Being an AWS service, CodeCommit scales automatically to meet the needs of the project. It ensures high availability and durability of your code.
    
5. **Security and Compliance**: CodeCommit complies with various compliance standards, and it integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing fine-grained control over repository access.
    
6. **Encryption**: Data in CodeCommit is encrypted in transit and at rest, ensuring the security of your code.

#### Typical Workflow with CodeCommit

1. **Creating a Repository**: You start by creating a new repository in CodeCommit or migrating an existing Git repository to CodeCommit.
    
2. **Local Environment Setup**: Developers configure their local Git environment to connect and authenticate with the CodeCommit repository.
    
3. **Code Operations**: Developers perform regular Git operations like clone, push, pull, branch, and merge. They can use their preferred IDE or command-line tools.
    
4. **Code Review and Collaboration**: Team members review code through pull requests and provide feedback or approval.
    
5. **Integrating with CI/CD**: Code changes in CodeCommit can trigger build and deployment processes in AWS CodePipeline, automating the software release process.

### Integration with External Repositories

AWS CodeCommit's ability to incorporate external repositories, such as those from GitHub or other third-party version control systems, is a significant feature that enhances its flexibility and utility in diverse development environments.

#### Integration with External Repositories

1. **Mirroring**: CodeCommit can be set up to mirror an external repository (like one from GitHub). This means it can automatically copy and sync the contents of an external repository to a CodeCommit repository. This is particularly useful for backup purposes or for transitioning from another VCS to CodeCommit.
    
2. **Migration**: Teams looking to move from other VCS platforms to CodeCommit can migrate their repositories. This involves transferring all the repository data, including commit history, branches, and tags, from the external system to CodeCommit.
    
3. **Pulling Changes**: You can also set up a workflow where changes from an external repository (e.g., GitHub) are periodically pulled into a CodeCommit repository. This is often used in scenarios where the primary development happens in another system, but the team wants to leverage AWS services for certain aspects of their workflow.
    
4. **CI/CD Integration**: By integrating with external repositories, CodeCommit can trigger AWS-based continuous integration and deployment pipelines when changes are made in the external repository. This allows developers to use their preferred version control platform while still taking advantage of AWS's robust CI/CD tools.
    
5. **Cross-Platform Collaboration**: This integration allows teams to collaborate across different platforms. For example, a team can host their main repository on GitHub for its community features while mirroring to CodeCommit for certain AWS-specific workflows.

#### How Integration is Achieved

- **Webhooks**: Setting up webhooks in external repositories to notify CodeCommit of changes, triggering sync or CI/CD processes.
- **Scripts and Tools**: Using custom scripts or tools like AWS Lambda functions to automate the syncing process.
- **AWS SDKs and APIs**: Leveraging AWS SDKs and APIs to create custom integration logic.

#### Example Use Case

Imagine a company that has been using GitHub for source control but wants to leverage AWS's cloud infrastructure for their CI/CD pipeline. They can set up a mirrored repository in CodeCommit. Every time a developer pushes changes to GitHub, a webhook triggers a process that syncs these changes to the corresponding CodeCommit repository. AWS CodePipeline can then automatically deploy these changes to AWS infrastructure, combining the strengths of GitHub's collaboration tools with AWS's deployment capabilities.

### IAM SSH Keys and HTTPS Git Credentials for AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit supports two primary methods for authenticating users and allowing access to repositories: IAM SSH keys and HTTPS Git credentials. Both methods are tied to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), ensuring secure access control.

#### IAM SSH Keys for CodeCommit

**What are IAM SSH Keys?**

- SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a pair of cryptographic keys that can be used to authenticate to an SSH server as an alternative to password-based logins.
- In the context of AWS CodeCommit, IAM users can generate SSH keys and associate them with their AWS IAM account to securely access repositories.

**How Do IAM SSH Keys Work?**

1. **Key Generation**: Users generate an SSH key pair on their local machine.
2. **Adding SSH Key to IAM**: The public key is uploaded to the IAM user's profile in the AWS Management Console.
3. **SSH Configuration**: Users configure their SSH client with the private key and a specific SSH key ID provided by AWS.
4. **Secure Access**: When users access a CodeCommit repository via SSH, AWS authenticates them using their IAM SSH key.

#### HTTPS Git Credentials for CodeCommit

**What are HTTPS Git Credentials?**

- HTTPS Git credentials are a username and password pair used by Git to authenticate over HTTPS.
- For AWS CodeCommit, these credentials are specifically generated for an IAM user to access repositories over HTTPS.

**How Do HTTPS Git Credentials Work?**

1. **Credential Generation**: Users generate HTTPS Git credentials for their IAM user through the AWS Management Console.
2. **Storing Credentials**: These credentials can be stored securely in a Git credentials store or entered manually when prompted during Git operations.
3. **Secure Access**: Access to CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS is authenticated using these credentials, ensuring secure communication.

#### Comparison and Use Cases

- **SSH Keys**:
    - Preferred for environments where SSH is commonly used, such as Linux or macOS.
    - Offers a higher security level as it uses cryptographic keys.
    - Ideal for users familiar with SSH and who require secure, password-less authentication.
- **HTTPS Git Credentials**:
    - More straightforward for users familiar with HTTPS-based Git operations.
    - Easier to set up on Windows environments.
    - Suitable for integration with tools that handle HTTPS authentication natively.

### Triggers in AWS CodeCommit

#### What are Triggers?

Triggers in AWS CodeCommit are automated responses to specific events in a repository, such as a push to a branch or a pull request creation. These triggers automate certain tasks, which can streamline processes like continuous integration and deployment, notification systems, and enforcing coding standards and policies.

#### How Do Triggers Work?

1. **Event Occurrence**: A trigger is set off by a specified event in a CodeCommit repository, such as a code commit, a branch or tag creation, or a pull request update.
    
2. **Trigger Action**: When the event occurs, the trigger executes an action. This can be a call to an AWS Lambda function, an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, or an AWS CodePipeline.
    
3. **Customization**: The action taken by the trigger can be customized. For example, it can start a build process, deploy code, send a notification, or run a custom script.

#### Use Cases of Triggers

- **Automated Builds and Tests**: Automatically start build and test processes in response to a commit or pull request.
- **Notifications**: Send email or SMS notifications to team members when certain actions occur in the repository.
- **Code Review and Approval Workflows**: Trigger actions or notifications when pull requests are created or updated, enhancing the code review process.
- **Enforcing Policies**: Automatically run scripts to check for policy compliance on new commits or pull requests.

#### Setting Up a Trigger in AWS CodeCommit

1. **Choose the Repository**: Begin by selecting the CodeCommit repository for which you want to create a trigger.
    
2. **Define Trigger Events**: Specify the events that will activate the trigger. This could be a push to a particular branch, a pull request creation, etc.
    
3. **Configure the Action**: Decide what action the trigger should perform. This could be invoking a Lambda function, sending a notification through SNS, or initiating a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.
    
4. **Set the Destination**: For Lambda functions, specify the function name. For SNS topics, provide the topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name).
    
5. **Name and Description**: Give your trigger a name and an optional description for easy identification.
    
6. **Test and Deploy**: Test the trigger to ensure it works as expected and then enable it in the repository.
    
7. **Monitor and Adjust**: After setting up the trigger, monitor its performance and adjust settings or actions as necessary.
