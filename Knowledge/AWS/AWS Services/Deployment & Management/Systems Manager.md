### SSM Agent

AWS Systems Manager is an agent-based service, relying on the AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) to facilitate management and automation tasks on your instances. Understanding how the SSM Agent works and its capabilities in collecting inventory information is key to leveraging AWS Systems Manager effectively.

#### SSM Agent: An Overview

1. **Agent-Based Service**:
    
    - The SSM Agent is a software agent that must be installed on instances (both in AWS and on-premises) that you want to manage through AWS Systems Manager.
    - This agent facilitates the execution of Systems Manager services, such as running commands, applying patches, and collecting inventory data.
2. **Automatic Installation**:
    
    - For convenience, the SSM Agent is pre-installed on many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), including both Windows and Linux-based AMIs.
    - If you're using an AMI without a pre-installed agent or on-premises servers, you can manually install the agent.

#### Inventory Management with SSM Agent

The Systems Manager Inventory collects and aggregates data about your instances. This data can include:

1. **Installed Software**: It can report on the software installed on an instance, helping in tracking software usage and compliance.
    
2. **File and Directory Data**: Inventory includes details about files and directories on the instance, which can be critical for security and compliance monitoring.
    
3. **Network Configuration**: Information about the instanceâ€™s network configuration, such as IP addresses, DNS information, and associated network interfaces.
    
4. **Patch Compliance**: The agent helps in monitoring the patch status of managed instances, ensuring that they are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    
5. **Hardware Details**: Collects data about the physical and virtual hardware on which the instance is running, including CPU, memory, and disk information.
    
6. **Running Services and Processes**: It provides details on which services and processes are running on the instance, which is essential for both performance monitoring and security.
    
7. **Windows Registry Data**: For Windows instances, it can collect information about the Windows Registry settings.
    
8. **Custom Inventory Data**: You can configure the Systems Manager Agent to collect custom data that you define, allowing for extensive flexibility in what you track and manage.

#### Additional Management Capabilities

Beyond inventory management, the SSM Agent enables several other AWS Systems Manager capabilities:

- **Executing Remote Commands**: Run shell scripts or PowerShell commands across multiple instances simultaneously.
- **State Manager**: Ensure your instances are in a desired state and maintain compliance with your defined configurations.
- **Patch Manager**: Automate the process of patching managed instances with both security-related and other types of software updates.
- **Parameter Store**: Access configuration data and secrets securely stored in Systems Manager Parameter Store.

AWS Systems Manager requires communication with an AWS public service endpoint for its operation. This setup involves IAM roles for security and networking configurations for connectivity. Let's delve into how this works and what's required for servers to utilize Systems Manager functionalities.

#### Systems Manager Endpoint as an AWS Public Service

1. **Public Service Endpoint**:
    
    - AWS Systems Manager interacts with a public service endpoint provided by AWS. This endpoint is necessary for the Systems Manager Agent on each server (EC2 instance or on-premises server) to communicate with the Systems Manager service.
    - The communication involves sending operational data to Systems Manager and receiving commands or configurations from it.
2. **Networking Requirements**:
    
    - For instances in AWS, if they are in a public subnet, they need internet access, typically via an Internet Gateway (IGW), to communicate with the Systems Manager public endpoint.
    - For instances in private subnets, or for enhanced security, you can use a VPC endpoint (specifically an AWS PrivateLink) for Systems Manager. This setup allows instances to communicate with Systems Manager without requiring public internet access.

#### IAM Role and Managed Role Permissions

1. **IAM Role for EC2 Instances**:
    
    - Each EC2 instance that utilizes Systems Manager needs to be associated with an IAM role that grants necessary permissions.
    - This role includes policies that allow the instance to communicate with the Systems Manager endpoint and perform required operations.
2. **Managed Policy for Systems Manager**:
    
    - AWS provides managed policies, such as `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`, which includes permissions for common Systems Manager actions.
    - Attaching this managed policy to the IAM role ensures that the EC2 instance has the necessary permissions for Systems Manager functionalities.
3. **Role Attachment and Trust Relationship**:
    
    - The role must be attached to the EC2 instances when they are launched or added later.
    - The trust relationship of the role should allow the EC2 service to assume the role on behalf of the instances.

#### Use Cases and Networking Considerations

- **Use Cases**: Systems Manager is used for a wide range of operations, including remote command execution, patch management, state management, and inventory collection.
    
- **Networking for On-Premises Servers**: For on-premises servers, a direct internet connection or a VPN connection to AWS is required to access the Systems Manager public service endpoint.
    
- **Security Considerations**: Using VPC endpoints (PrivateLink) for Systems Manager not only enhances security by keeping traffic within the AWS network but also allows instances in private subnets to utilize Systems Manager without direct internet access.

### Managing On-Premises vs AWS Resources

#### On-Prem

1. **Connectivity Requirements**:
    
    - On-premises servers need a secure connection to AWS for Systems Manager to manage them. This connection can be established through AWS Direct Connect or a VPN (Virtual Private Network).
    - AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection between your on-premises environment and AWS, while a VPN connection provides secure connectivity over the internet.
2. **Activation Code and ID**:
    
    - Unlike AWS resources, which are inherently integrated into the AWS environment, on-premises servers require an activation process to be managed by Systems Manager.
    - This process involves creating an activation in the Systems Manager console, which generates an activation code and ID. These are used to register on-premises servers with Systems Manager.
    - The activation code and ID are entered into the Systems Manager Agent running on the on-premises servers. This registration links the servers to your AWS account and allows them to be managed via Systems Manager.
3. **Systems Manager Agent**:
    
    - The SSM Agent must be installed on the on-premises servers, similar to how it's installed on EC2 instances.
    - Once the agent is installed and configured with the activation code and ID, it communicates with the Systems Manager service over the established secure connection.

#### AWS Resources

In contrast, AWS resources like EC2 instances have a more straightforward integration with Systems Manager:

1. **Inherent AWS Integration**:
    
    - EC2 instances and other AWS resources are natively integrated with AWS services, including Systems Manager. There's no need for activation codes or IDs as these resources are already part of the AWS environment.
2. **IAM Role for EC2 Instances**:
    
    - EC2 instances must be associated with an IAM role that grants necessary permissions for Systems Manager. This role allows the instances to communicate directly with the Systems Manager service.
3. **Network Connectivity**:
    
    - EC2 instances can communicate with the Systems Manager endpoint over the internet or through a VPC endpoint (PrivateLink), providing private connectivity within AWS.
4. **SSM Agent**:
    
    - The SSM Agent is pre-installed on many AWS AMIs, simplifying the setup process. For AMIs where it's not pre-installed, or for custom AMIs, the agent must be manually installed.

### Run Command

Systems Manager Run Command is a feature within AWS Systems Manager that allows you to remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances at scale. It enables you to execute predefined commands (like shell scripts or PowerShell commands), automating common administrative tasks without logging into each instance directly.

#### What is Systems Manager Run Command?

1. **Remote Task Execution**: Run Command provides a way to remotely execute commands on one or more AWS EC2 instances, as well as on-premises servers managed through Systems Manager.
    
2. **Safe and Secure**: It ensures secure execution of administrative tasks, reducing the risk associated with manual, interactive logins.
    
3. **Tracking and Auditing**: Each command execution is logged and audited, providing a history of changes and activities.

#### How Does Run Command Work?

1. **Selecting Targets**: You specify the target instances by instance IDs, tags, or resource groups. Run Command can target a single instance or multiple instances at once.
    
2. **Choosing a Command**: Choose from a list of predefined command documents (AWS provides many, like those for running shell scripts, applying patches, or updating software) or create your own custom documents.
    
3. **Executing the Command**: Once a command is issued, it is securely sent to the specified instances. The SSM Agent on each instance processes and executes the command.
    
4. **Monitoring Execution**: You can track the command's progress and view detailed execution results in the Systems Manager console. This includes success/failure statuses and detailed output logs.
    
5. **Rate Control and Error Thresholds**: Features like concurrency and error thresholds control how and when commands are executed. For example, you can set a command to run on a certain percentage of instances at a time or to stop if it fails on a certain number of instances.

#### Use Cases for Run Command

1. **Batch Configuration Changes**: Apply configuration changes to multiple instances simultaneously, such as editing configuration files or changing system settings.
    
2. **Software Installation and Updates**: Deploy software updates, patches, or install new software across your fleet of instances.
    
3. **System Maintenance Tasks**: Perform routine maintenance tasks like restarting services, clearing temporary files, or running cleanup scripts.
    
4. **Compliance Enforcement**: Ensure compliance across your instances by executing scripts that check and enforce compliance standards.
    
5. **Quick Remediation**: Respond quickly to operational issues by executing commands that can remedy common problems.
    
6. **Automated Administration**: Integrate with other AWS services and automation workflows to trigger command executions based on specific events or conditions.

#### Command Documents

Command documents in AWS Systems Manager Run Command are crucial for defining the specific actions to be performed on managed instances. They serve as templates for executing various tasks and operations.

##### What are Command Documents?

1. **Definition**: Command documents are JSON-formatted files that define the actions AWS Systems Manager performs on your instances. These documents specify the commands to run, parameters to use, and the order of execution.
    
2. **AWS-Provided and Custom Documents**: AWS provides a set of predefined command documents for common tasks. You can also create custom documents to define specific operations tailored to your needs.
    
3. **Parameters**: Command documents can include parameters, allowing you to pass values at runtime. This makes the documents more flexible and reusable across different scenarios.
    
4. **Idempotence**: Ideally, command documents should be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unexpected effects.

##### How Do Command Documents Work?

1. **Selection and Execution**:
    
    - You select a command document when executing a command via Systems Manager Run Command.
    - You can specify parameters and target instances for the command.
2. **Processing by SSM Agent**:
    
    - The SSM Agent on each target instance processes the command document and executes the defined actions.
    - The agent reports the execution status and results back to Systems Manager.
3. **Integration**:
    
    - Command documents can be integrated into automation workflows, allowing for complex operations like deploying applications, updating configurations, or orchestrating administrative tasks.

##### Example of a Command Document for a Windows Server Instance

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a custom command document that runs a PowerShell script to check disk space on a Windows server:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "description": "Check disk space on a Windows instance",
  "parameters": {
    "commands": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "The PowerShell commands to run.",
      "default": "Get-PSDrive C | Select-Object Used,Free"
    }
  },
  "runtimeConfig": {
    "aws:runPowerShellScript": {
      "properties": [
        {
          "id": "0.aws:runPowerShellScript",
          "runCommand": "{{ commands }}"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the document specifies a PowerShell command to get disk space usage of the C drive. It uses the `aws:runPowerShellScript` action to execute the command. The `commands` parameter can be overridden at runtime if needed.

#### Command Platform Options

Run Command allows you to execute commands on your managed instances in various ways, enabling flexibility and precision in targeting the instances you want to manage. You can run commands on individual instances, instances with specific tags, or instances within a particular resource group. Hereâ€™s an overview of each method:

##### Running Commands on Individual Instances

1. **Direct Targeting**: You can target specific instances by their Instance ID.
2. **Use Case**: Ideal when you need to perform an action on a particular server, such as troubleshooting, applying specific updates, or configuration changes.
3. **Process**:
    - In the AWS Systems Manager console or via CLI/API, you select the Run Command action.
    - Choose the command document to execute.
    - Specify the Instance IDs of the servers on which you want the command to run.

##### Running Commands on Instances with Specific Tags

1. **Tag-Based Targeting**: AWS allows you to assign tags (key-value pairs) to your resources. Run Command can target instances based on these tags.
2. **Use Case**: Useful for executing commands on a group of instances that share a common characteristic, like their role (`role:webserver`), environment (`env:production`), or any other custom attribute relevant to your operations.
3. **Process**:
    - While setting up the command, you specify the tag key and value pair(s) to target.
    - Only instances with the matching tags will execute the command, enabling you to perform broad yet targeted actions across your fleet.

##### Running Commands on Instances within Resource Groups

1. **Resource Group Targeting**: A resource group is a collection of resources that share one or more tags or other criteria. You can run commands on all instances within a specific resource group.
2. **Use Case**: Effective for scenarios where you have logically grouped your instances and other resources, such as all resources related to a specific application or project.
3. **Process**:
    - When initiating a Run Command action, you choose to target a resource group.
    - The command executes on all instances within the selected group, facilitating coordinated actions across related resources.

#### Command Documents

Command documents in define the specific tasks or set of operations to be executed on managed instances. These documents are versatile and can be customized and reused across various scenarios, making them an integral part of automating and managing your AWS environment.

##### What are Command Documents?

Command documents are JSON or YAML formatted files that specify the actions AWS Systems Manager should perform on your instances. These documents can contain scripts (bash, PowerShell, etc.), commands, or AWS API actions. They are used with Systems Manager Run Command and State Manager to automate tasks and ensure configurations on your instances.

##### Reusability and Parameters

1. **Reusability**:
    
    - Command documents are designed to be reusable. Once you create a command document, you can use it to execute tasks across different instances and environments.
    - This reusability ensures consistency in how tasks are executed and simplifies the management of your infrastructure.
2. **Parameters**:
    
    - Parameters within command documents add flexibility, allowing you to pass in specific values at runtime.
    - These could be values like file paths, configuration settings, or any other data relevant to the task at hand.
3. **Parameterization Benefits**:
    
    - Enhances the flexibility and reusability of the command document.
    - Allows the same document to be used in different contexts or environments by simply changing the parameters.
    - Reduces the need for multiple, nearly identical command documents.

#### Examples of Command Documents with Parameters

1. **Basic Example**: A command document to run a shell script with a parameter for the script location.
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "description": "Run a shell script from a specified location",
  "parameters": {
    "ScriptLocation": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "The S3 bucket location of the script"
    }
  },
  "mainSteps": [
    {
      "action": "aws:runShellScript",
      "name": "runscript",
      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": ["sh {{ScriptLocation}}"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, `ScriptLocation` is a parameter that can be specified at runtime, pointing to the location of the script to be executed.

2. **Windows PowerShell Example**: A command document for executing a PowerShell script with a parameter for an input string.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "description": "Run PowerShell commands",
  "parameters": {
    "InputString": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "Input string to be processed by the PowerShell script"
    }
  },
  "mainSteps": [
    {
      "action": "aws:runPowerShellScript",
      "name": "runpowershell",
      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": ["Write-Output 'Processing input: {{InputString}}'"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Here, `InputString` is a parameter whose value can be provided when the command is executed, allowing the PowerShell script to process different inputs dynamically.

#### Concurrency and Error Thresholds

Run Command includes features to control the execution of commands across multiple instances, notably through concurrency and error thresholds. Understanding and utilizing these features is essential for efficient and reliable task execution in complex environments.

##### Concurrency

1. **What It Is**: Concurrency in the context of Run Command refers to the number of instances on which a command can run simultaneously.
    
2. **How It Works**:
    
    - When you execute a command, you can specify the concurrency level either as an absolute number (e.g., "Run on 5 instances at a time") or as a percentage of the target set of instances (e.g., "Run on 10% of the instances at a time").
    - This setting ensures that the command does not overwhelm your infrastructure by running on too many instances at once, which is particularly important for resource-intensive operations.
3. **Use Case**:
    
    - Ideal for rolling out updates or changes in a controlled manner to prevent service disruptions.
    - Useful in scenarios where you want to limit the impact on your infrastructure, such as performing a staggered deployment or applying patches during operational hours.

##### Error Threshold

1. **What It Is**: The error threshold specifies the number or percentage of errors allowed before the command execution is stopped on remaining instances.
    
2. **How It Works**:
    
    - You set an error threshold when executing a command. If the command execution fails on a number of instances that meet or exceed this threshold, Systems Manager halts the command execution on any remaining instances.
    - The threshold can be an absolute number (e.g., "Stop if 3 errors occur") or a percentage (e.g., "Stop if errors occur on 10% of the instances").
3. **Use Case**:
    
    - Critical for minimizing the impact of faulty operations or failed updates.
    - Ensures that if a command is not executing as expected (possibly due to an error in the command itself or issues on the instances), it doesn't propagate the error across the entire environment.

##### Example Scenario: Rolling Out a Software Update

Imagine you're managing a fleet of EC2 instances and need to deploy a software update. Using Run Command with concurrency and error thresholds might look like this:

- **Concurrency Setting**: You set the concurrency to 10% to ensure the update process doesn't overload your server resources and allows for monitoring of the rollout progress.
- **Error Threshold Setting**: You set the error threshold to 5%. This means if the update fails on 5% of the instances, Systems Manager will stop rolling out the update to prevent widespread issues.
- **Execution**: The command begins executing on the first 10% of your instances. If less than 5% of these instances encounter an error, the command continues to the next set of instances. If the error threshold is reached or exceeded, the command stops, allowing you to investigate and address the issue before proceeding.

#### Run Command Outputs

##### Understanding Run Command Outputs

1. **What They Are**: Outputs from Run Command are the results or data returned by the command executed on each instance. This can include success/failure status, command output (like the output of a script or command), and log data.
    
2. **Where They Are Stored**: By default, the output of a command execution is stored within Systems Manager. For most commands, you can view the outputs directly in the AWS Systems Manager console.
    
3. **Size Limitation**: The Systems Manager console may limit the size of the output displayed. For larger outputs, you'll need to configure the command to send output to an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

##### Integrating Run Command Outputs with Other AWS Services

1. **Amazon S3**:
    
    - Run Command can be configured to send output to an S3 bucket. This is especially useful for commands that generate large outputs or when you want to archive outputs for long-term analysis or compliance.
    - To use this feature, you specify the S3 bucket name and key prefix in the command parameters.
2. **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**:
    
    - You can also direct the command output to CloudWatch Logs. This integration is valuable for real-time monitoring and analysis.
    - CloudWatch can be used to set up alerts based on specific log patterns or metrics derived from command outputs.
3. **AWS Lambda**:
    
    - You can trigger a Lambda function in response to Run Command execution results. This allows for automated responses to specific command outputs.
    - For example, a Lambda function could parse the output of a Run Command execution for errors and automatically create a ticket in an issue tracking system.
4. **Amazon CloudWatch Events**:
    
    - Run Command execution results can trigger CloudWatch Events. These events can then be used to initiate other automated workflows or notify stakeholders.
    - For instance, CloudWatch Events can trigger notifications through Amazon SNS when specific command outputs are detected.

##### Example Scenario: Patch Compliance Check

Consider a scenario where you're using Run Command to execute a script across a fleet of instances to check for patch compliance. Here's how outputs can be integrated with other services:

- **Run Command Execution**: The script checks the patch level of each instance and generates a report.
- **Output to S3**: The report is automatically sent to an S3 bucket for compliance records.
- **Output to CloudWatch Logs**: The summary of the execution is sent to CloudWatch Logs.
- **Triggering Lambda Function**: A Lambda function is triggered by the command's output, which analyzes the report for any instances that are not compliant.
- **Notification via CloudWatch Events**: If non-compliant instances are found, CloudWatch Events triggers an SNS notification to alert the IT team.

### Patch Manager

Patch Manager is a feature within AWS Systems Manager that automates the process of patching managed instances with both security-related and other types of software updates. It provides a streamlined and consistent mechanism for patching instances across your AWS environment and on-premises servers.

#### What is Patch Manager?

1. **Patch Management Tool**: Patch Manager helps you automate the process of patching your servers with software updates, primarily for security vulnerabilities but also for other updates.
    
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: It supports various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it a versatile tool for diverse environments.
    
3. **Integration with AWS Systems Manager**: As part of AWS Systems Manager, Patch Manager leverages other Systems Manager capabilities, like inventory management, for comprehensive patch compliance reporting and enforcement.

#### How Does Patch Manager Work?

1. **Define Patch Baselines**:
    
    - You define patch baselines to specify which patches to apply. These baselines can include rules for auto-approving patches by severity or release date.
    - Different baselines can be set for different groups of instances or different operating systems.
2. **Patch Groups**:
    
    - Instances are organized into patch groups, which are logical groupings of instances. Each group can be associated with a specific patch baseline.
    - This allows you to apply different patching policies to different groups of servers (e.g., development vs. production environments).
3. **Schedule Patching**:
    
    - Patching tasks can be scheduled according to your needs. This schedule can be defined to avoid operational interruptions, like patching during off-peak hours.
4. **Execute Patching**:
    
    - Patch Manager automates the process of downloading and applying patches according to the defined baselines and schedules.
    - It uses Systems Manager Run Command or State Manager to apply patches across the targeted instances.
5. **Monitoring and Compliance**:
    
    - Post-patching, Patch Manager provides detailed reports on patch compliance, showing which instances are compliant and which are not.
    - You can integrate these reports with other AWS services, like CloudWatch, for alerts and deeper analysis.

#### Use Cases for Patch Manager

1. **Security Compliance**: Ensures your servers are up-to-date with the latest security patches, helping to mitigate vulnerabilities.
    
2. **Automated Patching Across Environments**: Automate and standardize patching processes across your entire infrastructure, whether AWS or on-premises.
    
3. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Schedule patching activities during specific maintenance windows to minimize impact on operations.
    
4. **Compliance Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on patch compliance status to meet internal and external compliance requirements.
    
5. **Customized Patching Policies**: Tailor patching policies to different sets of servers, ensuring that patches are applied appropriately based on the criticality and function of each server group.

#### Patch Baselines

1. **Definition**: Patch baselines define a set of rules for which patches are approved for installation on your instances. They determine which patches are critical and should be applied, as well as the timeline for applying them.
    
2. **How They Work**:
    
    - You can create custom patch baselines specifying criteria like patch severity, product, or release date.
    - AWS also provides default patch baselines for common operating systems, which you can override with your own criteria.
    - Once defined, these baselines are used to evaluate and approve patches for instances.

#### Patch Groups

1. **Definition**: Patch groups are essentially labels assigned to instances to indicate which patch baseline should be applied to them.
    
2. **How They Work**:
    
    - You categorize instances into patch groups based on their function, environment, or any other criteria (like `Production`, `Development`, etc.).
    - Each patch group is then associated with an appropriate patch baseline. This allows different patching rules for different groups of instances.

#### Maintenance Windows

1. **Definition**: Maintenance windows are scheduled time periods during which Patch Manager performs patching operations on your instances.
    
2. **How They Work**:
    
    - You define a maintenance window by specifying a time range, frequency, and duration.
    - During this window, Patch Manager automatically applies approved patches to the instances in the associated patch group, ensuring minimal disruption to your operations.

#### Interaction Between These Components

- **Creating a Cohesive Patch Management Strategy**:
    
    - You start by defining one or more patch baselines according to the types of updates required for different sets of systems.
    - Next, you organize your instances into patch groups. Each group is linked to a specific patch baseline that aligns with the needs of those instances.
    - Finally, you schedule maintenance windows when the actual patching will occur. During these windows, Patch Manager applies the patches as per the rules defined in the patch baseline to the instances in the corresponding patch group.
- **Example Workflow**:
    
    - **Patch Baseline**: Create a baseline for Windows servers to install critical updates within 2 days of release.
    - **Patch Group**: Label your production Windows servers as `Prod-Windows`. Associate this group with the Windows patch baseline.
    - **Maintenance Window**: Schedule a maintenance window on the weekend during low-traffic hours for the `Prod-Windows` group.

#### How Systems Manager Inventory Works for Patch Compliance

1. **Collecting Inventory Data**:
    
    - Systems Manager Inventory collects data about the software, applications, and operating system settings on your managed instances. This includes detailed information about installed patches.
    - You can configure Inventory to collect data on a scheduled basis, ensuring that you have up-to-date information.
2. **Tracking Patch Compliance**:
    
    - The Inventory data includes details on the patch level of each instance. This information is used to determine whether an instance is compliant with the defined patch baselines.
    - You can view the patch compliance status directly in the Systems Manager console, which shows which instances are compliant and which are not based on the selected patch baseline.
3. **Customized Data Collection**:
    
    - Inventory allows customization of the data collected. You can specify additional custom data to be collected, providing more granular control over compliance tracking.

#### Integration with Patch Manager

- Systems Manager Inventory works in conjunction with Patch Manager to provide a comprehensive view of patch compliance. Patch Manager applies the patches based on your specifications, and Inventory collects and reports on the patch status of each instance.

#### Querying and Reporting

1. **Querying Inventory Data**:
    
    - Systems Manager allows you to query Inventory data to quickly identify instances that are non-compliant or missing specific patches.
    - These queries can be customized to focus on specific aspects of compliance, such as instances missing critical security patches.
2. **Reporting**:
    
    - The Inventory data can be used to generate reports for compliance auditing and operational monitoring.
    - Reports can be exported for use in external systems or for sharing with stakeholders to demonstrate compliance.
