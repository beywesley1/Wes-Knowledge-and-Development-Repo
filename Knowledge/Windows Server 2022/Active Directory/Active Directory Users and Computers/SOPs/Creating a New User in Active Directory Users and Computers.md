Creating a new user in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) is a common task for administrators managing an Active Directory (AD) environment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### Pre-requisites

- Ensure you have administrative privileges in the Active Directory domain.
- Make sure you are logged into a machine that has ADUC installed. This could be a domain controller or a workstation/server with Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) installed.

### Steps to Create a New User

1. **Open Active Directory Users and Computers**:
    
    - Click on the Start menu and type "Active Directory Users and Computers", or find it in the Administrative Tools folder within Server Manager.
2. **Navigate to the Appropriate Organizational Unit (OU)**:
    
    - In the ADUC console, navigate through the domain to find the Organizational Unit (OU) where you want to create the new user. If you don’t have a specific OU, you can create the user in the default 'Users' container.
3. **Create a New User**:
    
    - Right-click on the OU or container where you want to add the user.
    - Select “New” and then click on “User”.
4. **Fill in the New User Details**:
    
    - A wizard will open to create the new user.
    - Enter the first name, last name, and full name of the new user. The "User logon name" field will be used by the user to log into the domain.
    - Click “Next”.
5. **Set the User Password**:
    
    - Enter and confirm a password for the user account.
    - Decide on the appropriate password options such as “User must change password at next logon”, “User cannot change password”, “Password never expires”, or “Account is disabled”. These options should be chosen based on your organization’s policy.
    - Click “Next”.
6. **Review and Complete**:
    
    - Review the information you’ve entered. If everything is correct, click “Finish” to create the new user account.

### Post-Creation Configuration

- **Set Additional Properties**: Once the user account is created, you can set additional properties by right-clicking on the user and selecting “Properties”. Here, you can configure settings like email addresses, telephone numbers, group memberships, profile paths, and more.
- **Group Memberships**: For the user to have access to specific resources, you might need to add them to certain security groups. This can be done in the “Member Of” tab in the user properties.

### Best Practices

- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Stick to a consistent naming convention for user logon names and full names.
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that the initial password is strong and adheres to the organization's password policy.
- **Minimum Necessary Permissions**: Only grant the user the minimum permissions necessary for their role.
