### Comment / Uncomment Code

In Visual Studio, you can comment out and uncomment code using keyboard shortcuts. Here's how you do it:

1. **To Comment Out Code:**
    
    - Select the lines of code you want to comment.
    - Press `Ctrl` + `K`, then `Ctrl` + `C`.
2. **To Uncomment Code:**
    
    - Select the commented lines of code you want to uncomment.
    - Press `Ctrl` + `K`, then `Ctrl` + `U`.
  
For macOS users using Visual Studio, the keyboard shortcuts for commenting and uncommenting code are slightly different due to the different keyboard layout. Here's how you can do it:

1. **To Comment Out Code:**
    
    - Select the lines of code you want to comment.
    - Press `Cmd` + `K`, then `Cmd` + `C`.
2. **To Uncomment Code:**
    
    - Select the commented lines of code you want to uncomment.
    - Press `Cmd` + `K`, then `Cmd` + `U`.

These shortcuts use the `Cmd` key instead of the `Ctrl` key, which is the standard modifier key for most actions on macOS.

### Highlight and Change All of Specific Word

1. **Highlight the Term:**
    
    - First, highlight or select the term you want to find and replace in your code.
2. **Open Find and Replace:**
    
    - Press `âŒ˜` + `Option` + `F`. This will open the "Find and Replace" dialog. If you had text selected, it should automatically appear in the "Find" field.
3. **Enter the New Term:**
    
    - In the "Replace with" field, enter the new term or phrase that you want to use as a replacement.
4. **Replace Options:**
    
    - Use the following options for replacing:
        - **Replace:** This will replace the current instance of the term.
        - **Replace All:** This will replace all instances of the term in the current document.
        - **Next** and **Previous:** These buttons allow you to navigate through the instances of the term.
5. **Scope of Replacement:**
    
    - You can choose the scope of your replacement. Typically, this can be the current document or the entire solution, depending on your needs.
6. **Preview Replacements:**
    
    - Visual Studio for Mac may not have as extensive a preview feature as the Windows version, but it's still a good practice to check the instances before you replace them, especially in a large codebase.
