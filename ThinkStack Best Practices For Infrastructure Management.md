For clients aiming to enhance their AWS ecosystem with new resources, including projects, servers, storage upgrades, computing enhancements, databases, hybrid networking, or vendor-specific solutions, it is essential to initiate the process by opening a ticket with ThinkStack. This step ensures that ThinkStack can evaluate the request to determine whether it is directly actionable or if scheduling a project is necessary.

#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Why Use ThinkStack for AWS Resource Management?</mark>

ThinkStack leverages Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage AWS resources efficiently. This approach brings several advantages:

- **Automation and Consistency:** Terraform automates the provisioning of resources, ensuring consistent setups across different environments without manual errors.
- **Scalability:** As environments grow, Terraform's ability to manage infrastructure through code makes scaling more manageable and less error-prone.
- **Version Control:** Terraform configurations can be versioned, allowing for controlled updates and rollbacks, ensuring infrastructure stability.
- **Cost Management:** By defining infrastructure as code, Terraform allows for better forecasting and control of AWS costs by preventing over-provisioning and optimizing resource usage.

#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The Importance of Using Terraform over Manual Console Provisioning</mark>

Provisioning resources directly through the AWS console, especially in environments expected to scale, introduces risks such as configuration drifts, inconsistency, and manual errors. Terraform, by defining infrastructure as code, ensures that resources are provisioned in a repeatable, predictable manner, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of scaling environments.

#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Risks of Bypassing ThinkStack for AWS Provisioning</mark>

Provisioning resources without the involvement of ThinkStack not only bypasses the efficiency and control offered by Terraform but also introduces significant risks. Should these independently provisioned resources encounter issues or fail, rectifying these problems can be substantially more complex and resource-intensive than if ThinkStack had initially managed the process. The absence of ThinkStack's oversight means missing out on strategic planning, optimization, and the application of best practices, leading to potential inefficiencies and vulnerabilities.
